# Active Context: Infinite Scroll Implementation

**Date:** 2025-06-19

## 1. Issue Identified

A complex bug in the `NewsFeed.tsx` component's infinite scroll caused both race conditions and runaway fetching. The root cause was an incorrect implementation of the `IntersectionObserver` that was not robust enough for React's render lifecycle.

### Symptoms:
- Skipped pages due to aborted fetches.
- Uncontrolled, sequential fetching of all available pages without user interaction.
- Observer failing to attach to the trigger element after the initial load.

## 2. Root Cause

The initial implementation attempted to manage the `IntersectionObserver` with `useEffect` and direct state dependencies, which led to stale closures and incorrect re-initialization logic. The observer was either firing when it shouldn't have or failing to attach to its target element at the correct time.

## 3. Solution: The Callback Ref Pattern

The final, correct solution was to refactor the observer logic to use the idiomatic React **callback ref** pattern.

**File:** `frontend/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx`

**Change:** The `useEffect`-based observer was replaced with a `useCallback` hook that serves as the ref for the trigger element.

```javascript
  const observer = useRef<IntersectionObserver>();
  const loadMoreTriggerRef = useCallback((node: HTMLDivElement | null) => {
    if (loading) return; // Prevents re-attaching while a fetch is in progress.
    if (observer.current) observer.current.disconnect(); // Disconnects the old observer.

    // Creates a new observer with a fresh closure over `hasMore`.
    observer.current = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
      // The check for `!loading` is crucial here to prevent race conditions.
      if (entries[0].isIntersecting && hasMore && !loading) {
        setCurrentPage(prevPage => prevPage + 1);
      }
    });

    // If the trigger node exists, observe it.
    if (node) observer.current.observe(node);
  }, [loading, hasMore]); // The callback is re-created only when loading or hasMore changes.
```

This pattern ensures the observer is always correctly attached/detached and always has access to the latest `loading` and `hasMore` states, preventing all previously observed bugs.

## 4. Best Practice Alignment

This solution improves **Robustness** and **Performance** by using a standard, modern React pattern (`useCallback` refs) designed specifically for managing interactions with DOM nodes.
