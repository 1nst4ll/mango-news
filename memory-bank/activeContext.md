# Active Context: Infinite Scroll Race Condition

**Date:** 2025-06-19

## 1. Issue Identified

A race condition was discovered in the `NewsFeed.tsx` component's infinite scroll implementation.

### Scenario:
- Initial load (page 1) works correctly.
- When the user scrolls to trigger the load for page 2, the `loading` state is not set to `true`.
- Because `loading` remains `false`, the `IntersectionObserver` can be triggered multiple times if the user scrolls, causing the in-progress fetch for page 2 to be aborted and a new fetch for page 3 to begin prematurely.
- This results in skipped pages and unpredictable loading behavior.

## 2. Root Cause

The `fetchArticles` async function within the primary data-fetching `useEffect` hook was not setting the `loading` state to `true` before initiating the API call for subsequent pages (pages 2+). The `loading` state was only being set for the initial component mount.

## 3. Solution

The fix is to explicitly set the loading state at the beginning of every fetch operation.

**File:** `frontend/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx`

**Change:** Add `setLoading(true);` at the start of the `fetchArticles` function.

```javascript
    const fetchArticles = async () => {
      console.log('[NewsFeed] fetchArticles function invoked.');
      setLoading(true); // <-- This line was added
      fetchInProgressRef.current = true; // Set flag when fetch starts
      try {
        // ... rest of the fetch logic
```

## 4. Best Practice Alignment

This change improves the **Robustness** of the component by ensuring predictable and stable state management during asynchronous data fetching, preventing race conditions.
