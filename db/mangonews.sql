Emergency services responded, and fortunately, "no injuries have been reported," the release stated.\n\n\nThe RTCIPF continues to emphasise its commitment to proactive policing.\n\n\nAnyone with information that could support future operations is encouraged to contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-8477, the nearest police station, 911, or the Serious Crime Unit at 231-1842. \n\n\nAdditionally, individuals can "download and use the Crime Stoppers P3 app to submit information anonymously".

Central to the initiative was Invest TCI’s partnership with DMZ Canada, a leading global start-up incubator.\n\n\nThe morning opened with welcome remarks from Acting CEO of Invest TCI, Ms Judith Garland, followed by a keynote address delivered by Mrs Anissa Adderley, Director of the Business Support Unit. Mrs Adderley reaffirmed the agency’s commitment to empowering entrepreneurs and cultivating a thriving innovation ecosystem. Remarks from Ms Alexandra Ali-Dib, Senior Manager of Global Programmes, and Mr Darren Shivraj, Programmes Lead, both from DMZ, underscored the strength of the partnership and DMZ’s continued investment in developing high-potential start-ups in emerging markets such as the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n\nLaunched earlier this year, the Accelerator and Incubator Programmes currently support 48 active participants across diverse sectors, including agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, creative industries, and technology. By encouraging entrepreneurial talent in these areas, the programmes serve as a catalyst for innovation and strategic sector diversification. Notably, a significant trend emerging across both cohorts is the rise of women-led businesses, which now represent most participants, highlighting women’s critical role in shaping the economic future of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n\nA key highlight of the event was the "Creating Linkages: A Private Sector Perspective” segment, led by Hon Tamell Seymour, Member of Parliament for South Caicos and General Manager at Graceway Smart. Hon Seymour shared practical insights on closing the gap between entrepreneurship and market access, underscoring the value of strong private sector engagement.\n\n\nParticipants also heard compelling stories from programme members, including Ms Mary Fulford of Island Mystique, representing the Accelerator Programme, and Ms Alexa Cooper, an early-stage entrepreneur in the Incubator Programme. Their testimonials demonstrated the real-world impact of Invest TCI’s support and the resilience of emerging local businesses.\n\n\nMrs Anissa Adderley, Director of the Business Support Unit, stated: "This event is more than a calendar milestone; it’s a celebration of vision, commitment, and the powerful potential of entrepreneurship in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Through these programmes, we’re not just building skills; we’re cultivating a network, \nfostering innovation, and shaping a future where local entrepreneurs are empowered to succeed.”\n\n\nThe event concluded with a vote of thanks delivered by Mrs Charlene Astwood, followed by a vibrant networking session where attendees engaged with each other, mentors, and partners over breakfast.\n\n\nInvest TCI’s Business Support Unit continues to lead initiatives that build the capacity of early-stage and growth-oriented businesses through mentorship, funding access, and global partnerships.

2	Lola-Reign Cook And The Pink Assassins Secure Major Victory In Cheerleading At Allstar Worlds Championship 2025	2	https://suntci.com/lolareign-cook-and-the-pink-assassins-secure-major-victory-in-cheerleading-p12608-130.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	After years of tireless dedication, unwavering perseverance, and a fierce love for the sport of cheerleading, Lola-Reign Cook, whose mother and grandmother are from Turks and Caicos Islands, clinched her first-ever Allstar Worlds Championship title from April 15 to 18, 2025, in Orlando, Florida, as a “flyer” for TopGun Allstars Orlando’s Pink Assassins.\n\nThe Allstar Worlds Championship is one of the most prestigious competitions in the world of cheerleading. Each year, elite teams from around the globe must qualify through top placements and receive invitations to compete in this elite event. Lola’s team, the Pink Assassins, scored a fully paid bid by winning their first competition of the season at East Coast Nationals in Daytona Beach Florida. It is the ultimate stage where the best of the best face off in a weekend filled with high-flying stunts, synchronized routines, and explosive energy — all driven by months of grueling preparation and passion.\n\nLola-Reign, the daughter of Sakera Cook and granddaughter of Pastor Lillian Boyce, both of Turks and Caicos Islands, is known affectionately as “Lola” to her teammates. She is more than just a standout flyer. She is a competitive, sweet, and unstoppable force who practically lives in the gym. A natural tumbler with an iron work ethic, Lola-Reign has become a known name in her gym for her focus, her grace under pressure, and her relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nThis win is especially meaningful after three previous trips to Worlds, including a heartbreaking second-place finish last season. To finally hear her team’s name called as champions marked not just a victory, but a culmination of years of bruises, sacrifice, resilience, and big dreams.\n\n“People see the glitter and the bows,” said her mom, Sakera Cook, “but they don’t always see the blood, sweat, sore muscles, and late-night practices. Lola’s win shows that hard work and heart do pay off.”\n\nThe Pink Assassins, part of the TopGun Allstars family, represent one of the most elite cheer programs in the country. With multiple locations across the U.S and even the U.K. TopGun is renowned for their technique, creative choreography, and commitment to athlete development. They consistently produce national and international champions, and Lola’s win adds to that incredible legacy.\n\nDespite being just 13, Lola-Reign is already a senior, seasoned competitor, having won multiple national titles and traveled coast to coast for competitions; from Las Vegas to Dallas, Washington D.C. to Charlotte. Her dream? To cheer professionally and one day own her own cheer gym, empowering the next generation of young athletes to rise just like she did.\n\nFor Lola-Reign, cheerleading is not just a sport. It’s a lifestyle. It’s family. And after this week, it’s officially championship glory.\n\nAbout Allstar Cheerleading:\n\nAllstar cheer is a competitive sport that combines stunts, tumbling, dance, and teamwork. Athletes train year-round, often committing more hours than traditional sports. It’s physically demanding, mentally tough, and filled with personal sacrifice. It teaches discipline, time management, resilience, and the value of every single team member.\n\nAbout TopGun Allstars:\n\nFounded in Florida, TopGun is one of the most respected Allstar programs in the world. With numerous Worlds titles, innovative routines, and a culture of excellence, TopGun continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in cheerleading.\n\nCommenting on her success, Lola stated: “Winning a championship is more than just a title; it is the culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and unwavering support from those around me. As I stand here today, basking in the glory of my achievement, I reflect on the incredible journey that has brought me to this moment. After four years of relentless effort, I am proud to say that I have finally claimed the top spot. This victory is not just mine; it belongs to everyone who has been a part of this journey.”\n\nShe added: “My first year was a lesson in perseverance. Finishing fifth was disheartening, but it ignited a fire within me. I realized that every setback was an opportunity to learn and grow. With each passing year, I pushed myself harder, fueled by the dream of standing on that podium as the champion. My second year brought me to seventh place, a reminder that success often requires patience and resilience. It was during these challenging moments that I learned the importance of grit and determination.”\n\nShe noted that in her third year she felt the thrill of being very close to her goal, finishing in second place.\n\n“It was a bittersweet moment, a taste of what could be, but also a reminder that I had more work to do. With the support of my incredible family and friends, I resolved to come back stronger. I owe a debt of gratitude to my mom and dad (Denario Cook), who have always believed in me, cheering me on from the sidelines and encouraging me to keep pushing forward. Their unwavering faith in my abilities has been my anchor, reminding me that I am never alone in this journey,” Lola added.\n\n“I also want to express my heartfelt thanks to my Nana (Pastor Dr. Lillian Boyce) and Pop (Hayden Boyce), who have been my biggest supporters. Their love and encouragement have been a constant source of strength, reminding me of the importance of family and the power of belief. To my friends, my little sister Lily and brother Devine, thank you for being my cheerleaders and for sharing in both my triumphs and struggles. Your camaraderie has made this journey all the more meaningful.”\n\n“And I cannot forget my teammates and coaches, whose dedication and guidance have shaped me into the athlete I am today. Together, we have faced challenges, celebrated victories, and forged bonds that will last a lifetime. Our collective spirit and teamwork have been instrumental in pushing each of us to reach our fullest potential. Coaches, your wisdom and unwavering support have been invaluable, teaching me not only the skills of the sport but also the importance of sportsmanship and perseverance.”\n\nLola continued: “This year, as I stood atop that podium, the weight of my journey washed over me. It was a moment of incredible relief, joy, and gratitude. I realized that this victory is a testament to the power of resilience and the importance of having a strong support system. It serves as a reminder that dreams are worth chasing, no matter how many obstacles we face along the way.”\n\n“To anyone reading this, I want to share a message of motivation: Embrace every challenge as an opportunity to grow. Surround yourself with those who uplift you, and never underestimate the power of hard work and determination. Remember that every setback is a stepping stone toward success. With passion, perseverance, and the support of loved ones, you can achieve greatness.”\n\nAs she celebrates this victory, Lola said she carries with her the lessons learned and the love shared along the way.\n\n“This championship is not just a personal achievement; it is a shared triumph, a testament to the power of community and belief. Together, we can conquer any challenge that comes our way. Here’s to the journey ahead and the dreams yet to be realized!” she added.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:21.447882-04	2025-04-28 19:12:34.282793-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-11-16-08-am-6112344.png	Unknown Author	\N
344	Is The Turks And Caicos Political System Guided By A Clear Set Of Ideas?	2	https://suntci.com/is-the-turks-and-caicos-political-system-guided-by-a-clear-set-of-ideas-p12642-111.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	The Turks and Caicos Islands has one of the most stable, informed and politically aware citizens and institutions that could be found anywhere. Its people are open-minded, they question what is said to determine its validity, and respect the rule of law and the constitution which give institutions their shape and character.\n\nThere are guidelines in various documents providing information on what is to be done and how, for both the public and private sectors, which mean there is not the sense of a lack of public awareness regarding the conduct of public life and societal institutions.\nBut what are the overall ideas and values that underpin the totality of the way the society and social and political system function? What keeps the political system on track? What is the philosophy guiding everything?\n\nSome societies have an ideology. Does the TCI have a uniform set of beliefs which serve to integrate the society at large, and its practices?\n\nIn the TCI, the behaviour and attitudes of the society at large do not conform to a clear pattern. Nor are they based on a common and identifiable set of principles or norms. Rather, the way persons behave is based on inherited assumptions, what was said or heard, even told in the home. Even the way they speak, and the choices they make, are home-based. And each home is different. This is why when faced with challenges, the response is different. In one case it could be aggressive, while the same issue could be dealt with more calmly by different residents.\n\nAgain, Turks and Caicos society is influenced by different denominations, which provide unique perspectives on various topics. They differ in the way they conduct their religious affairs, which impacts their perspectives. It is not as divisive as some other countries, but the differences are there, and this informs how they see the world and themselves. This disposition also influences their thinking, and their politics.\n\nIn many other countries, even the developed ones, religion is a point of reference for their activities. It is also alleged that religion and the political system influence each other. In the TCI the influence is not that pronounced.\n\nBut generally, the political system and the role it plays in society, intertwine with religious organisations and the social life of the public in the various functions it performs. For example, because the political system is all pervading, as the representative government it is invited to participate in many activities, and political officials welcome this asa means of interacting with constituents. The political system invites citizens to participate in making laws for good governance, and is called on to respond to any emergency whether natural, or community- based.\n\nHowever, can it be said that despite this, in the case of the TCI, is the political system itself guided by a clear set of ideas that are comprehensive?\n\nA political system consists of a set of interconnected elements, each representing a particular area of society, for example, the social, economic, religious, and cultural aspects. Linked they represent a system. The political system although an important element, takes precedence inits overall configuration.\n\nSo what are the ideas that guide the political system? They come from decision-making. Here when an unusual development occurs, the decision-making process goes into action. The situation is assessed, different ideas are posed, and those that appear quite workable are utilised. It is these ideas, in part, that guide the system.\n\nSince the system is fluid, no particular remedy suffices.\n\nAgain, a new event might emerge because of the interaction of the system with other partners. Here, previous strategies could be refined which upgrade the quality of the response, resulting in a more appropriate solution fit. These ideas become integral to other measures that could be undertaken as potential solutions unfold.\n\nThe political system may discover that there are existing elements within, that pose ideas that are too conservative or radical, which prevent policy initiatives from moving forward at the pace which brings better results. It then needs to take measures in its best interest. These actions could include finding a balance within the context of ideas, and from this, the most useful are selected and utilised.\n\nPolitical reasoning and intelligence are used to determine the ideas that best fit the situation to enable the appropriate policy objectives to be met. Here, ideas are not imported, but generated internally by the system itself, and used to guide it to achieve the set objectives. The ideas are not previously set and then drawn down on to fit a situation.\nThey are always in the process of developing triggered by the needs of the system.\n\nAs was initially indicated, the Turks and Caicos political system is not governed by a distinct political ideology, or clear set of ideas. This makes it flexible, and able to respond swiftly to emergencies. Potential problems are therefore prevented from expanding and becoming more complex. This type of political system also prevents bureaucracy from impeding important development initiatives. It manages time efficiently, gets things done without much delay, and is dependable and trustworthy. It is also open to new technologies and the ideas that come with it, including more effective management systems.\n\nThe political system in the TCI is therefore open-minded, tolerant, with no tendency towards being authoritarian or oligarchic.\n\n* Oliver Mills is a former lecturer in education at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus.

Subscribers are urged to continue making their regular contributions, which are essential to ensuring the uninterrupted delivery of healthcare services at the highest standards, both locally and abroad.\n\nInterim Chair of the NHIB, Mrs. Shonia Been, said, “The Board is actively working to maintain a seamless experience for subscribers and providers alike. “We are focused on ensuring that healthcare access remains uninterrupted and that the trust placed in us by the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands is honoured.”\n\nThe NHIB encourages all insured persons, employers, and self-employed individuals to continue making monthly contributions. These payments are critical to sustaining the national health insurance system and enabling the Board to meet its obligations to local and overseas healthcare providers, ensuring that beneficiaries receive the care they need without disruption.\n\nCommenting on the NHIB, the Minister of Health and Human Services, the Hon. Kyle Knowles, stated, “This is a time of renewal and strengthening for the NHIB. While internal assessments are ongoing, the public can be confident that the Board remains open for business and that healthcare delivery is not only stable but being actively protected and improved. We urge all subscribers to continue making their monthly payments, as their contributions directly support our ability to deliver care to every resident who needs it.”\n\nTo further enhance transparency and accountability, contracted examiners, Interpath, have commenced a comprehensive forensic examination of the Board’s operations and financials. This process aims to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the NHIB continues to operate in the best interest of the people.\n\nThe public is further advised that all NHIB offices throughout the Islands are open for business and ready to assist with queries, claims, registrations, and payments. Customer service teams are available to support subscribers and guide them through any concerns.\n\nAs the organisation continues to strengthen its internal operations and governance, it reaffirms its mission to promote the health and well-being of every resident through a fair and sustainable insurance system.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:04:15.679643-04	2025-04-27 18:04:15.679643-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NHIB-door.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
61	Turks & Caicos Delegation attends COP26 in Glasgow	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2021/11/turks-caicos-delegation-attends-cop26-in-glasgow/	2021-11-05 00:00:00-04	#TurksandCaicos, November 5, 2021 – The Ministry of Tourism, Environment, Fisheries, Maritime Affairs, Culture & Heritage, Agriculture, Religious Affairs and Gaming, represented by the Hon. Minister Josephine Connolly and Director Lormeka Williams, from the Department of Environment & Coastal Resources (DECR), are currently\n attending the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, UK.\n\nThe summit has brought parties together, including the UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs) Association Delegation, to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. While in Glasgow, the Hon. Minister has had access to the ‘Blue Zone’, the UN-managed space that hosts the negotiations and brings together delegations from 197 countries. The Zone was the venue for the World Leaders’ Summit on November 1st & 2nd. On November 6th the Overseas Territory delegation (which includes the Turks & Caicos Islands) will host an event for Nature and Land Use Day. The event will explore how the UKOTs are taking action to counter and mitigate the effects of global warming and how they are safeguarding precious marine environments.\n\nHonourable Minister Connolly engaged at the highest level, with her Caribbean counterparts, on topics which include reopening strategies and tourism-related impacts and the way forward as it pertains to COVID-19, as well as issues of sustainable financing for climate change resilience for island-states.\n\n“For the future, we must shift to sustainable development and mainstreamed resilience practices, and arm ourselves with the data, expertise, and modelling required to understand how Climate Change will impact our society and environment. We need improved comprehension of increased impacts of flooding, intense heat, drought, and storms, and regional realities like Climate Change-induced migration. To mainstream Climate Change resilience, we need expertise, and capital and recurrent funding, while at the same time not sacrificing other vital conservation projects and programmes. “, said Hon. Minister Connolly.\n\nAt COP26 countries are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets (NDCs) that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century. This is particularly pertinent to the Caribbean region as island-states, including the Turks & Caicos Islands, find themselves on the frontline of the impacts of climate change. Coral reefs, vital to our economy, are less resilient to disease and our reefs are more susceptible to bleaching impacting the overall biodiversity of our marine ecosystems. We are most vulnerable to the increase in sea levels and are starting to see the impacts on our communities as land stability is threatened on a daily basis. Each year we face more intense storms, with hurricane season arriving earlier and ending much later.\n\n \n\nCaptions:\n\nHeader: L-R; Hon.

71	Hurricane Season is Over but not before Record-setting storms Killed Hundreds and Cost Billions	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2024/12/hurricane-season-is-over-but-not-before-record-setting-storms-killed-hundreds-and-cost-billions/	2024-12-03 00:00:00-05	Garfield Ekon\n\nStaff Writer\n\n \n\n \n\nDecember 3, 2024 – The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season came to a close on Saturday, bringing to an end a season that saw 11 hurricanes compared to the average seven, and death and destruction hundreds of miles from where storms came ashore on the United States (U.S.)  Gulf Coast.\n\nMeteorologists called it a “crazy busy” season, due in part to unusually warm ocean temperatures. Eight hurricanes made landfall, in the U.S., Bermuda, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Grenada.\n\nHurricane Beryl became the first Category 4 hurricane on record to form in the month of June, slamming into the island of Carriacou in Grenada. In Jamaica it went on to destroy crops and houses and left two dead. The last time the island was scraped by a Category 4 hurricane was Dean in 2007, making it “pretty rare,” said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.\n\nThe storm then intensified into the earliest Category 5 hurricane ever in the Atlantic on July 1. Major hurricanes — Category 3 and above —\n are not usually seen until September 1, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIn September, Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the southeastern U.S. and was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. More than 200 people died. North Carolina estimates the storm caused at least $48.8 billion in direct or indirect damages with houses, drinking water systems and farms and forests destroyed. Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia also sustained extensive damage.\n\nIn October, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified and the storm’s maximum wind speeds hit a screaming 180 mph, making it one of the strongest hurricanes by wind speed ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The only one stronger by that measure was Hurricane Rita in 2005.\n\nThe areas where Helene and Milton struck saw as much as three times their usual rainfall for September and October, the heart of the Atlantic hurricane season. For Asheville, Tampa and Orlando, the two-month period was the wettest on record.\n\nIn November, Hurricane Rafael reached 120 miles per hour (MPH), and was nearly the strongest November hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico, tying with Hurricane Kate in 1985. Rafael made landfall in Cuba and battered the island as it was trying to recover from widespread blackouts caused by Hurricane Oscar in October.\n\nPlanet-warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane released by transportation and industry are causing oceans to rapidly warm. Several factors contribute to the formation of hurricanes, but unusually warm oceans allow hurricanes to form and intensify in places and times we don’t normally anticipate, McNoldy said.\n\n“In other words, we never had a storm as strong as Beryl so early in the season anywhere in the Atlantic and we never had a storm as strong as Milton so late in the season in the Gulf of Mexico,” he said.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:11.032815-04	2025-04-27 18:05:11.032815-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hurricane-Asheville.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
72	Rain event brings Major Flooding, now PWD Assessing new Flood Prone areas	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2024/12/rain-event-brings-major-flooding-now-pwd-assessing-new-flood-prone-areas/	2024-12-02 00:00:00-05	Deandrea Hamilton\n\nEditor\n\nTurks and Caicos, December 2, 2024 – There was no tropical cyclone but hours of relentless rainfall in the Turks and Caicos on Wednesday November 27 exposed new flood prone zones forcing weather, disaster and public works authorities to issue alerts and warnings.\n\nOne to two inches of rainfall was in the forecast, but in waterlogged, low lying areas that meant more like two to three feet of water; a disaster for motorists, pedestrians and home owners, by 3pm Wednesday November 27, a flood warning was issued.\n\n“WHAT…Intermittent rounds of showers and thunderstorms through tonight could result in localized flooding across much of the Turks and Caicos Islands. About 1 to 2 inches is possible for much of the area.  WHERE…Providenciales: Lower Bight, Along Leeward Highway (near Cash N’ Carry, Business Solutions, Do It Center, Caicos Lodge), Downtown, Five Cays, Kew Town, Millennium Highway, Industrial Drive, Long Bay. Middle Caicos: Northern parts of Conch Bar, Bambarra, Lorimers. North Caicos: Kew Settlement, Whitby, Sandy Point, Bottle Creek. Grand Turk: Waterloo, Palm Grove, West Road, Cockburn Town, Back Salina, Overback, North Creek.  South Caicos: Town/The Flats, Airport Road, Old Airport Road.”\n\nThe information supplied by the Turks and Caicos Weather Service impacted all major islands and was also distributed by the TCI Department of Disaster Management and Emergencies.\n\nVideos and photos of the accumulation of water in areas of Providenciales were captured and shared on social media.  From a young man caught on camera surfing through the murky rain water to at least one vehicle being covered, almost completely, it was a soggy start to the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend.\n\n“The Public Works Department, within the Office of the Deputy Premier and Ministry of Physical Planning and Infrastructure Development wishes to inform the public of ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of recent heavy rainfall and localised flooding.\n\nOvernight, the department conducted extensive flood-reducing measures in several vulnerable areas to ensure the safety of residents and maintain accessibility to essential roadways and infrastructure. Vulnerable areas currently receiving assistance are Long Bay, Long Bay Hills, and Leeward Palms on Providenciales,” said a Department statement issued on Thursday.\n\nThe weather service had warned that the flood alert would remain in effect until Thursday 9 a.m.\n\n“Key measures undertaken overnight includes the installation of drainage wells where PWD crews worked tirelessly to achieve this.  These drainage wells will facilitate water flow and reduce flooding. Additionally, stationary pumps were active and mobile pumps deployed to flood-prone areas to divert accumulated water and prevent overflow.”\n\nFor those experiencing the inundation due to the rain event, there was exasperation.  Years of flooding in the same areas, with often identical remedies being reported generated calls for adequate drainage to be installed.  Some saying, the idea of wells was not working\n\nDamage to homes and other properties including farms has not yet been made available, but there was concern for recent road repairs.\n\nThe Public Works Department assured residents that there was active response, assessment to determine if there were new flood areas and deployment of resources to clear roadways and neighbourhoods of water.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:17.978529-04	2025-04-27 18:05:17.978529-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG-20241203-WA0000.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
73	Hurricane Warnings on for many as Tropical Strom Raphael takes aim	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2024/11/hurricane-warnings-on-for-many-as-tropical-strom-raphael-takes-aim/	2024-11-05 00:00:00-05	Garfield Ekon\n\nStaff Writer\n\n \n\n \n\nNovember 5, 2024 – A hurricane warning has been issued for the Cayman Islands and lesser alerts for parts of Cuba and Jamaica, as a weather system being monitored in the Caribbean developed into a tropical depression Monday morning.\n\nThe system was forecast to continue strengthening, the National Hurricane Center said, potentially becoming a tropical storm by the end of the day and a hurricane by Wednesday. Currently, Tropical Storm Raphael is moving at NW at 13 mph with tropical storm form winds extending outwards, 105 miles, from the centre.\n\nThe hurricane center said in an advisory Monday that the system was expected to approach the northwestern part of Cuba around the time\n it reaches hurricane strength. “On the forecast track, the system is expected to move near Jamaica late tonight, be near or over the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and approach Cuba on Wednesday,” forecasters said.\n\nThey wrote in an earlier advisory that the system “could be near or at hurricane intensity when it passes near the Cayman Islands and Cuba.” As of 4 a.m., Tuesday, the tropical storm was about 170 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica and 425 miles southeast of Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands. It was moving with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the center reported.\n\nMaximum sustained winds of 74 mph are needed for classification as a hurricane.\n\nThe Miami-based National Hurricane Center said the heaviest rainfall is forecast to occur over Jamaica and parts of Cuba through mid-week. Rainfall will likely be accompanied by hurricane conditions in the Cayman Islands by Tuesday afternoon, and, possibly, in western Cuba and the Isle of Youth on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions were expected to arrive in Jamaica by Monday night.\n\n“Rainfall totals between 3 to 6 inches with locally up to 9 inches are expected. Flooding could occur over portions of Jamaica and Cuba, with mudslides possible,” the center noted. Heavy rainfall will spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of the southeast United States in the mid-to-late week, the center said.\n\n“Models are in disagreement of where it will track after it reaches the Gulf,” Nolan says, “but the Gulf coasts from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida need to be on alert for impacts at the end of the week.”\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:23.687352-04	2025-04-27 18:05:23.687352-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hurricane-warning-photo.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
47	Recent outbreaks in the Americas underscore need to urgently address immunization gaps, PAHO Director says	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/recent-outbreaks-in-the-americas-underscore-need-to-urgently-address-immunization-gaps-paho-director-says/	2025-04-24 00:00:00-04	Over 66 million vaccine doses to be administered during Vaccination Week in the Americas, including 2.7 million doses of measles-containing vaccine\n\n \n\nWashington, DC, 24 April 2025 (PAHO) – As countries in the Americas confront outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and yellow fever, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, called for urgent action to address gaps in immunization coverage.\n\n“Over the past five decades, vaccines have saved 154 million lives worldwide, reducing child mortality by 41% in the Americas alone”, the PAHO Director said during a press briefing held today ahead of Vaccination Week in the Americas— a flagship initiative led by PAHO, taking place from April 26 to May 3. However, “our progress against vaccine-preventable diseases needs a strong and lasting commitment to implement the appropriate public health measures.”\n\nWorldwide, confirmed measles cases exceeded 359,000 in 2024. This, combined with gaps in vaccination coverage, have led to localized outbreaks across six countries in the Americas, with 2,313 reported cases so far this year —up from just 215 during the same period in 2024. Three deaths have been confirmed, and another is under investigation.\n\n“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world,” Dr. Barbosa said. “Yet countries have struggled to sustain the recommended 95% coverage of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which leaves us susceptible to imported cases.”\n\nProgress has been made in recent years. For the first time since 2019, MMR1 coverage increased in 2023, reaching 87% across the Americas. Despite this improvement, there remains a significant gap: 1.4 million children in the Region did not receive any dose of the MMR vaccine that year. Outbreaks have been observed in communities where just 3% to 7% of individuals were susceptible, highlighting the risk posed by even small pockets of low coverage.\n\nDuring this year’s Vaccination Week in the Americas countries across the Region plan to administer an estimated 66.5 million doses of vaccines, including 2.7 million targeting measles. Now in its 23rd year, the initiative has so far enabled over 1.2 billion people to be vaccinated since its launch in 2003. Under the slogan “Your decision makes the difference. Immunization for all,” countries are mobilizing to reach those at highest risk of missing vaccines, especially children.\n\nIn 2025, the Region has also seen an uptick in yellow fever, with four countries reporting 189 cases so far, including 74 deaths, compared to 61 cases and 30 deaths reported during 2024.\n\nTo address these outbreaks, PAHO is working with countries to tackle vaccine hesitancy, strengthen routine immunization programs, and expand access to vaccination through the use of microplanning and digital tools such as electronic immunization registries and geographic information systems. These tools help monitor coverage, identify gaps, and “stop the virus in its tracks,” Dr. Barbosa said.\n\nDr. Barbosa also highlighted the importance of the PAHO Revolving Fund, a pooled procurement mechanism that allows countries in the Americas to access high-quality vaccines at affordable prices. “Without the Fund, countries would pay at least 75% more for the Region’s 13 most common vaccines,” he said.\n\nWhile Vaccination Week in the Americas “remains a cornerstone of public health in the Region,” Dr. Barbosa emphasized that “immunization does not end with Vaccination Week.”\n\nThe Americas has a legacy of leadership in vaccination and disease elimination. The Region was the first to eliminate smallpox in 1974 and polio in 1994, and has also eliminated measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, maternal and neonatal tetanus, and outbreaks of urban yellow fever.\n\nNow, PAHO is supporting countries through its Disease Elimination Initiative, a bold effort to eliminate more than 30 diseases and related conditions by 2030, 11 of which are vaccine preventable.\n\nIn 2024, the Region successfully regained its status as free of endemic measles. While this status remains intact, recent outbreaks serve as a reminder of the ongoing risk and the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent the reestablishment of endemic transmission.\n\n“The Region of the Americas is ours to protect,” Dr. Barbosa said. “By working together, throughout vaccination week and beyond, we can build a stronger, safer, and healthier Americas,” the PAHO Director concluded.\n\nVaccination Week in the Americas\n\nVaccination Week in the Americas is a regional initiative that aims to promote equity and access to vaccination in all countries of the Region of the Americas. The theme this year, “Your decision makes a difference. Immunization for all,” highlights the urgent need to prevent the spread of life-threatening diseases and keep each one of us, our families, and our communities, safe.\n\nThe Regional launch of the week will take place on Monday, 28 April, in Panama. National launches and initiatives will also be held throughout the Region.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:59.538455-04	2025-04-27 18:02:59.538455-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-24-184524.png	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

Philip Davis broke ground for the Coconut Grove Advanced Health Centre.\n\nDespite rainy and windy conditions on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, the day was deemed a “big comeback” after Hurricane Matthew had derailed ongoing repairs to the Coconut Grove Clinic in 2016.\n\nPrime Minister Davis delivered the keynote address for the Ground Breaking Ceremony at the site on Grasmerd Bend, Baillou Hill Road, just opposite the National Insurance Board.\n\n“It’s good to be here. I know the weather might not look too good today, but believe me when I say that every day we draw closer to a brighter, healthier future for The Bahamas is a good day,” he said.  “Today is a comeback.  A big comeback.”\n\nFor nearly 45 years the old Coconut Grove Clinic provided essential maternal and child health services, general care and health education to all who passed through its doors.  But after it sustained damage from Hurricane Matthew, services were transferred to the nearby Baillou Hill Road and Fleming Street clinics.\n\nThe new facility will restore services to those residents in the surrounding areas of St. Barnabas, Englerston, and Bain and Grants Town.\n\nThe prime minister observed that the reality is that extreme weather events are threatening lives and the systems which preserve them.\n\n“My administration was determined not to let this clinic – and many other clinics throughout our islands – fall through the cracks again. We\n are working, every day, across every island, to improve the lives of Bahamians,” he said.\n\nUnderscoring that health is an important component of his administration’s Blueprint for Change, the prime minister further noted that expanding health infrastructure, maximizing access to health services, and driving positive health outcomes are among the top priorities.\n\n“In breaking ground on the Coconut Grove Advanced Health Care Centre, we are making progress on each of these fronts. Accessible healthcare will soon be at your doorstep,” he said.\n\nThe Coconut Grove Advanced Health Centre will be built to Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification, making it not just sustainable and handicap accessible, but climate resilient.  It will be a 14,500-square-foot facility built on the four-acre site at just over $10.5 million.  Construction is mobilized and is expected to be completed in approximately 15 months.\n\nThe Hon. Dr. Michael Darville, Minister of Health and Wellness, said that the facility will serve as a community clinic providing primary and urgent care services, taking some of the strain off the Princess Margaret Hospital’s Accident and Emergency Department.\n\n“It is designed to reduce waiting time, improve access to care and give residents a welcoming environment that supports prevention, early detection, and long term wellness,” he said.\n\nProfessionals involved in the project include: project architect, Livingstone Forbes; structural and civil engineers, Island Dimensions Development Company; mechanical and electrical engineers, Chris Symonette and Associates; general contractor, A & M Construction Company Ltd.; and the ministry’s quantity surveyor Veritas Consultants Ltd.\n\n \n\n(BIS Photos/Mark Ford)\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:03:05.780411-04	2025-04-27 18:03:05.780411-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ground-Breaking-Ceremony-scaled.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

Minister of Health and Human Services, the Acting Permanent Secretary of Health and Human Services, and senior officials from various departments and units within the Ministry of Health and Human Services. Meetings were convened in both Grand Turk and Providenciales. The delegation also visited Cockburn Town Medical Center, where they toured the facility, including the Primary Health and Dental Departments and interacted with staff.\n\nThe highlight of the visit was the recognition from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) of the Turks and Caicos Islands for its exceptional efforts in the surveillance, prevention, and control of respiratory viruses over the past ten years. The country was awarded for its collaboration with the Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Network (SARINET) and the REVELAC-1 network. This recognition highlights the islands’ leadership in early detection, prevention strategies, and effective outbreak control, underscoring the importance of global partnerships in addressing future health challenges.\n\nThe primary objectives of the visit were to:\n\nIdentify and reach consensus on common strategic priorities and focus areas for PAHO’s Technical Cooperation in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\nDiscuss the implementation, coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of key programme areas under the PAHO Biennial Work Plan 2024–2025.\nAlign strategic objectives with one or more of the nine (9) targets under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,” as well as other health-related SDG targets.\nProvide technical updates and support on ongoing health projects and programme initiatives, and those planned for the 2025/2026 financial year.\n\nSpeaking on the significance of the visit and the award, the Hon. Kyle Knowles Minister of Health and Human Services, stated:\n\n“We are extremely pleased to welcome our partners from PAHO to the Turks and Caicos Islands. This visit reflects our shared commitment to strengthening our local health system and improving the well-being of our people. We are honoured to receive this award in recognition of our decades-long collaboration with PAHO, which has been instrumental in advancing key health initiatives across our islands. Through continued partnership, we remain committed to building a resilient, inclusive, and high-quality health system for all.”\n\nThis mission forms part of the Ministry’s ongoing efforts to foster strong partnerships with PAHO/WHO and other regional stakeholders. These partnerships continue to play a vital role in the development and execution of key health policies, strategies, and plans that aim to enhance the health and well-being of all residents of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nPHOTO CAPTIONS:\n\nHeader:  MOH team Grand Turk L-R (Ms. Crivanne Adams, Ms. Betty Ann Been, Ms. Leanne Sills, Dr Alicia Malcolm, Ms. Kendra Malcolm.

50	TCI Builds Regional Resilience with Advanced Training in Arbovirus Detection and Surveillance	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tci-builds-regional-resilience-with-advanced-training-in-arbovirus-detection-and-surveillance/	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands – Tuesday, 15 April 2025:  In a stride towards enhancing regional health security, the Turks and Caicos Islands proudly hosted a week-long, high-level laboratory training focused on strengthening the diagnostic detection and surveillance of arboviruses. Held from 24 – 28 March 2025, the intensive workshop was facilitated by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) under the framework of the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) Zika Programme. The sessions were conducted under the expert guidance of Nikhella Winter-Reece, an internationally recognised Laboratory Technologist Consultant with the European Union Division of Surveillance, Disease Prevention and Control, Laboratory Services and Network.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the EDF Zika Programme has become a beacon of hope and progress for the Caribbean, delivering vital support to bolster public health systems against mosquito-borne threats. Through this programme, countries like the TCI continue to benefit from regional expertise, collaborative knowledge exchange, and state-of-the-art practices, which reinforces our collective ability to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nParticipants in the workshop engaged in both theoretical and hands-on practical sessions designed to sharpen laboratory techniques,\n improve the availability and use of surveillance data, and strengthen multi-country coordination in responding to arboviral outbreaks. This training not only empowered local health professionals but also reaffirmed the TCI’s commitment to the fight against emerging public health threats.\n\nMosquito-borne illnesses—such as Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever—remain an ongoing global challenge, with over 700 million infections and more than one million deaths reported annually according to the World Health Organisation. These viruses, spread by infected mosquitoes and other arthropods, often flourish in warm weather, making tropical and subtropical regions particularly vulnerable. Infections can range from mild fevers and rashes to more severe complications, underscoring the need for timely detection and effective prevention strategies.\n\n“The battle against arboviral diseases is a shared responsibility,” stated Ms. Arlene Siebs, Director of the National Public Health Laboratory. “Through initiatives like this, we’re not just improving local capacity—we’re building a regional network of skilled professionals who are better equipped to respond swiftly and effectively.”\n\nCommenting on the workshop, Honourable Minister of Health and Human Services Kyle Knowles stated: “The National Public Health Laboratory continues to push the boundaries of diagnostic excellence by embracing cutting-edge technology and fostering strategic partnerships. This training represents a proactive investment in the health and well-being of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands—and by extension, the Caribbean. This workshop underscores the power of regional solidarity and the importance of sustained investment in public health infrastructure. With every training, every test, and every shared lesson, the Caribbean moves one step closer to a healthier, more resilient future. The TCI was happy to host such a critical workshop.”\n\nPlease follow the Ministry of Health and Human Services Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/tciministryofhealth for updates and health information.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:03:16.268702-04	2025-04-27 18:03:16.268702-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image002-5.png	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
51	Turks and Caicos Islands Observes World Health Day 2025: Prioritising Maternal and Newborn Health	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/turks-and-caicos-islands-observes-world-health-day-2025-prioritising-maternal-and-newborn-health/	2025-04-10 00:00:00-04	PRESS RELEASE\n\nFROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH\n\nAND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProvidenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands – Thursday, 10 April 2025: On 7 April 2025,  The Ministry of Health and Human Services joins the global community in recognising World Health Day under the theme “Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures.” This year, the focus is on ensuring every mother and baby in the Turks and Caicos Islands has access to quality care for a healthy start in life.\n\nA healthy pregnancy begins with early antenatal care, which is crucial for protecting both mother and baby. Women who receive early and regular check-ups are more likely to have safer pregnancies, healthier babies, and fewer complications during childbirth. The Ministry of Health and Human Services advocates for early antenatal care, available at all primary healthcare facilities across the Turks and Caicos Islands. Pregnant women are encouraged to start their antenatal visits as soon as they learn they are expecting to receive the best possible care.\n\nBenefits of Early and Consistent Antenatal Care\n\nRegular check-ups provide essential medical support, guidance, and protection for both mother and baby. Here’s how early and consistent antenatal care helps:\n\nKeeps Mother and Baby Healthy: Regular check-ups ensure both mother and baby are doing well.\nTracks Growth and Health: Checks include measuring blood pressure, weight, and ensuring the baby is growing properly.\nCatches Problems Early: Issues like low iron, high blood sugar, or infections can be found and treated before they worsen.\nSafer Pregnancy and Birth: Early care helps prevent serious complications and makes delivery safer.\nProvides Important Nutrients and Vaccines: Mothers receive vitamins like iron and folic acid, and vaccines like the tetanus shot to prevent infections.\nGives Helpful Pregnancy Advice: Doctors and nurses guide mothers on healthy eating, staying active, and avoiding harmful substances like smoking and alcohol.\nSupports Mental Health: Pregnancy can bring emotional changes, and care includes support to help mothers feel their best.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Human Services ensures the highest quality care is available for delivery and the period immediately after, supporting both mother and child. Importantly, care for mothers and babies does not stop at childbirth. Postnatal care is available at all Primary Health Care facilities, ensuring that both mother and newborn receive necessary medical attention in the critical weeks following delivery. Postnatal care helps monitor recovery after birth, provides guidance on breastfeeding and infant nutrition, and supports mothers in adjusting to life with a newborn. It also helps detect and address postpartum complications such as infections, excessive bleeding, and mental health concerns, including postpartum depression.\n\nChildhood Immunisations\n\nVaccination is crucial in protecting children from serious illnesses and ensuring they grow up healthy. The Ministry of Health and Human Services encourages all parents to ensure their children receive recommended immunisations as part of routine pediatric care. Childhood vaccines protect against diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and whooping cough, preventing serious health complications and reducing the spread of infections within communities. By keeping up with the immunisation schedule, parents provide their children with the best protection against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nHonourable Kyle Knowles commented, “The health of mothers and babies is the foundation of strong families and communities. Ensuring access to early antenatal care, quality postnatal care, and essential childhood vaccinations is a key priority for the Ministry of Health and Human Services. These services are vital to reducing pregnancy-related complications, supporting new mothers, and protecting our children from preventable diseases. I encourage all expectant mothers in the Turks and Caicos Islands to visit their nearest primary healthcare facility as soon as they know they are pregnant. Likewise, I urge parents to keep up with their children’s immunisations to give them the best start in life. Together, we can ensure healthier beginnings and brighter futures for our families.”\n\nFor more information on antenatal and postnatal care services, as well as childhood immunisations, visit your nearest primary health care facility:\n\nCheshire Hall Medical Centre: 338-5472\nBlue Hills: 946-5613\nGrand Turk: 338-5461\nNorth Caicos/Middle Caicos: 247-2126 / 431-0911\nSouth Caicos: 946-3800 / 345-7360\n\nPlease follow the Ministry of Health and Human Services Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/tciministryofhealth for updates and health information.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:03:21.762611-04	2025-04-27 18:03:21.762611-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-2.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
52	Emailer Threatens Our Children; ‘Close Down the School’	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/emailer-threatens-our-children-close-down-the-school/	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Deandrea Hamilton\n\nEditor\n\n \n\nTurks and Caicos, April 25, 2025 – Turks and Caicos national security leaders were deliberately vague about what led to their snap decision to shut down schools across Providenciales this week. The likely reason was to avoid panic after they were alerted to the dangerous and frightening prospect of what some anonymous sender planned to inflict upon the children, families and at least six private schools in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n“The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force (RT&CIPF), in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture, has launched an active investigation following the receipt of suspicious emails to six schools earlier this evening.\n\nAt this stage, police intelligence has not confirmed the legitimacy of the threats. However, the police force is treating the matter with the utmost seriousness.”\n\nHowever, holding onto the precise threat spelled out in those ghastly emails, meant parents remained frustratingly clueless about what was so serious that it prompted school officials, to late on Wednesday night, ask them to not to drop their children to school.\n\nSchools which were in session complied with the police statement, though we understand there was no direct communication with school administrations.\n\nMagnetic Media also learned that those now infamous emails, dispatched to half a dozen schools including the International School, Precious Treasures, Provo Primary and British West Indies Collegiate, contained a bone-chilling threat to shoot at the schools this Friday, April 25, 2025.\n\n“…you’ve been randomly selected for a shooting I recommend to have minimal damage done to close the school.  You will be given a 24Hr notice and a 12 Hr notice, God bless.”\n\nThere was no blessing obviously and thankfully, no violence.  Some of the schools targeted with the violent email are still on Easter Holiday.\n\n“A joint meeting between education officials and senior police officers was convened promptly after the emails were reported. The RT&CIPF’s Intelligence Unit is fully engaged and working to trace the origin of the messages.\n\nWe understand that these messages may cause concern and wish to assure the public that everything possible is being done to protect our school communities,” informed the police press statement.\n\nThe statement came after 10 p.m. on Thursday April 23.\n\nThe sender, identified in the email as ‘Charles Millson’ and issued the threat to multiple schools via their staff accounts about 12 hours earlier, just minutes before 10 a.m. on April 23.  In the subject line: ‘Close Down the School.’\n\nIn this age of hyper-advanced technology, the email probably emanated from a phony account created to perpetrate this crime, which is in violation of the Summary Offences Ordinance, where ‘causing fear’ is cited as a crime and the Firearms Ordinances, which carries a weighty penalty of a 12-year minimum mandatory prison time for possession of an unlicensed gun and ammunition.\n\nAuthorities are expected to update the public on the progress of the investigation and its next steps. Students will remain home on Friday.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:03:26.806818-04	2025-04-27 18:03:26.806818-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pg-1.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

As a result of this, one suspected gang member is currently in police custody in connection with the discovery.\n\n\nCommissioner of Police Fitz Bailey: "The seizure of these dangerous weapons sends a clear and unequivocal message — we will not tolerate violence and lawlessness in our communities.”\n\n\nBailey said the bust has potentially prevented the loss of life and further acts of violence against law-abiding citizens. "Our officers remain resolute in their mission to pursue individuals who possess and traffic illegal firearms. Seven firearms have been seized from January 1 to April 23. Five of which were pistols. The recovered weapons have been sent for ballistic testing.”\n\n\nHe said the operation forms part of the police force’s intensified anti-crime suppression activities aimed at removing illegal firearms from the streets, disrupting criminal networks, and enhancing public safety.\n\n\n"Our anti-crime efforts remain focused on high-visibility and intelligence-driven operations. The successes recorded over the past week are a testament to our officers' dedication and hard work towards achieving our crime reduction targets for 2025 and making the islands safer,” the newly confirmed commissioner of police \nstated.\n\n\nPolice said they will continue to conduct targeted operations, including road traffic stops and search exercises, in areas harbouring priority offenders and suspects.\n\n\nResidents and visitors are reminded of their vital role in supporting law enforcement efforts. As such, anyone with information regarding illegal activities is urged to contact the nearest police station, dial 911, the Serious Crime Unit at 231-1842, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-8477, or on the Crime Stoppers P3 to report anonymously.

We thank you for your commitment, which was demonstrated, and we look forward to your continued support as we build resilient states," she said during a reception at the Shore Club.\n\n\nAs the TCI steps into this leadership role, the stakes could not be higher. \n\n\nThe upcoming 2025 hurricane season, with predictions of 17 named storms and multiple major hurricanes, looms.\n \nThe TCI's chairmanship of CDEMA is seen as a crucial opportunity for the territory to demonstrate its commitment to disaster preparedness and resilience, not only for itself but for the entire Caribbean region.

By law, Turks and Caicos Islanders must be given the first opportunity for available job positions within the country.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential need for supplementary migrant workers to support ongoing developments, the Labour and Employment Services Department strongly urges all employers and the wider public to prioritise qualified Turks and Caicos Islanders for all job openings.\n\nTo effectively facilitate this process and gain a comprehensive understanding of the local workforce, the Labour and Employment Services Department is actively registering unemployed and underemployed Turks and Caicos Islanders. This vital initiative will allow the Department to identify available skill sets within the TCI, significantly aiding in the thorough vetting of employment applications.\n\n“This Government remains resolute in its commitment to placing Turks and Caicos Islanders at the forefront of national development", said Minister of Immigration and Border Services, Hon. Jamell Robinson.\n\n“The priority is, and will always be, to ensure our people are afforded every opportunity to participate meaningfully in the labour market. We will continue to enforce the policies and laws that safeguard this principle, and we urge all stakeholders to do the same. The prosperity of these Islands must begin with the empowerment of its people.”\n\nThe Department wishes to remind the public of the guidelines it adheres to when reviewing applications for migrant workers, ensuring that such applications are considered only when a genuine need has been established after due consideration of the local workforce.\n\nThe Labour and Employment Services Department remains dedicated to fostering a fair and equitable labour market that benefits all residents of the Turks and Caicos Islands. We encourage all Turks and Caicos Islanders to register with us at jobregistration@gov.tc to ensure their skills and availability are known, contributing to the growth and prosperity of our nation.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:34.013331-04	2025-04-28 19:12:47.558973-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-49-24-am-4253243.png	Unknown Author	\N
302	PDM requests Attorney General recuse herself from election petition case -Cites conflict due to AG's dual role as Law Revision Commissioner	1	https://tcweeklynews.com/pdm-requests-attorney-general-recuse-herself-from-election-petition-case-p15007-155.htm	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Delana Isles•April 25, 2025\nThe People’s Democratic Movement (PDM) is calling for the Attorney General, Hon Rhondalee Braithwaite-Knowles, to step down as the legal representative for the election commission in the ongoing election petition case before the court.\n\n\nThe party submits that there is a conflict of interest. Last week, the party – through its attorney George Missick, filed an application with the court requesting that the AG recuse herself from the case since she cannot act as the legal representative while also serving as a witness testifying to matters pertinent to their case.\n\n\nAccording to Missick, the issue arose at the last hearing when the Attorney General sought to clarify why there were issues with the ballot papers at the February 7 elections – the main point of contention in the PDM election petition. \n\n\nHer argument at the time was that the Law Revision Commissioner of the Turks and Caicos Islands, who combines revised laws of the TCI, made some errors during the process. Several amendments have been made to the Election Ordinance since the 2021 general election, requiring the changes to the legislation to be combined. \n\n\nThe attorney general contended in her submission to the court that this should not affect the outcome of the election, as the Law Revision Commissioner cannot change the law.   \n\n\nMissick said that such matters should be ventilated during the trial and not at the pre-trial stage. As such, they have expressed a need to call the Law Revision Commissioner to present this evidence. \n\n\nThe lawyer said he discovered the conflict when preparing for the May 12 and 13 trial and sought out the Law Revision Commissioner as a witness in the case. \n\n\nAs it turned out, the Attorney General is the Law Revision Commissioner of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n\nThis has led the party to request that the Attorney General recuse herself as legal counsel for the Election Supervisor. To which she has reportedly indicated that there is no conflict. \n\n\nThe PDM said the conflict arises because the Attorney General should not act as an advocate in a matter in which she is a witness.\n\n\nThe party said the matter, which is before Judge Chris Selochan for determination, will be heard when the court resumes in the new week\n\n\nAccording to the TCI Bar association’s website: "Ordinances of the Turks and Caicos Islands are generally reproduced by a Revised Edition of the Laws of the Turks and Caicos Islands from time to time pursuant to the \nRevised Edition of the Laws Ordinance CAP 1.02 by the Law Revision Commissioner, who is currently the Attorney General of the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hon. Rhondalee Braithwaite-Knowles OBE.”\n\n\nLast month, Judge Selochan ruled that the petition calling for fresh elections - brought by Leader of the PDM, Edwin Astwood and Deputy Leader Robert Been - has merit and will go to trial. \n\n\nJudge Selochan, as such, dismissed the Attorney General’s application to strike out the PDM’s claims. \n \nThe Petition for Trial \nShortly after the February 7 general election, the PDM Leader and Deputy Leader filed a petition against the Supervisor of Elections and the Attorney General, citing irregularities in the ballot papers used in February’s general elections, among other discrepancies.\n\n\nThe party is seeking to have the election and return of the members declared null and void and to order a new Writ of Election for fresh parliamentary elections. They are also requesting that the counterfoils to the ballot papers and/or the ballots for the All Island be scrutinised.\n\n\nAlong with the irregularities, the petition cites machine malfunctions and voter disenfranchisement.\n\n\nThe petition filed on February 14 by Geordins Law Firm, claims that the ballot papers used in the election failed to comply with legal requirements in that: a single ballot paper was used for both electoral district and \nAll Islands votes, in contravention of the Ordinance; the ballot paper was of a uniformed colour, instead of the legally required two distinct colours; and the ballot papers were not published by the Supervisor of Elections in accordance with section 6 of the Ordinance.\n\n\nIt outlined that during the manual recount of the ballots in at least two districts, it was discovered that approximately 20 ballot papers had been cast with the voters only voting for the All Island candidates and not the electoral district candidates. It cites the possibility of voter confusion.\n\n\nAccording to the petition, various polling stations experienced machine malfunctions: "In electoral district 9, the voting machine at the station serving voters with surnames A-J malfunctioned, causing delays and forcing the station to open late.\n\n\n"The machine failed again at 12:00 pm, preventing eligible voters from casting ballots for approximately forty (40) minutes. The machine experienced further failure at 5:00 pm, disrupting the voting process and effectively disenfranchising voters who were unable to cast ballots before the polls closed.\n\n\n"In Electoral District No. 3 (South Caicos), the voting machines failed to read ballots correctly due to the incorrect type of ink being used on pens provided at the polling station.”\n\n\nIt noted that these technical failures directly impacted voter participation and undermined the integrity of the election, constituting a breach of the fundamental right to vote as protected by law and the Constitution of the TCI.\n\n\nPDM further contends that there was also an unlawful denial of a recount request. It cited that a request for a recount was made by Anthony Walkin, the PDM candidate for electoral district 8 (Blue Hills), and separately by a PDM representative seeking a recount of the All Islands ballots.

"Medical costs around the world are high, and TCI is not exempt."\n\n\nHe warned that putting the full burden of healthcare costs on the government would be a "significant strain," stressing the "heightened level of responsibility to make your contributions." \n\n\nKnowles also announced a "greater emphasis on compliance," noting that "there are some persons compelled not to pay, right, but still want medical services to be rendered."\n\n\nAcknowledging that there may be "internal breakdowns" in communication, such as individuals being told they are not registered or their accounts are not up to date, Knowles assured that the government is working to address these issues. \n\n\nHowever, he reiterated, "The truth behind it is that in order for that to be a fluid process, you need to make sure that your payments are up to date. Because if we're going to make sure that the systems speak to each other. It can't be a situation where you're not paying, but you're asking for medical care."\n\n\nPermanent Secretary Lewis echoed these sentiments, highlighting the benefits that Turks and Caicos Islanders currently enjoy. "Imagine, if you are sent overseas for treatment abroad, the government pays 100% of your care, 100% not 80% , she said. \n\n\nLewis urged the public to "continue to pay into the scheme" and to ensure payment slips are registered with the NHIB to track contributions.\n\n\nRegarding the future of healthcare in the islands, Knowles shared his vision, emphasising "accessibility, affordability and delivering the level of service that we need for our people, and of course, coupled with stability and continuity." \n\n\nHe spoke of building local capacity, stating, "We have local practitioners who are expanding on their businesses or their medical operations, who can avail themselves of a lot of these services." \n\n\nBy building local capacity, Knowles hopes to "spend locally" some of the money currently spent abroad, "so people can now come to us for medical care."\n\n\nKnowles also addressed the need for preventative healthcare, noting that "people show up to the hospital with stage four cancer." \n\n\nHe explained, "If you're addressing it from a preventative standpoint, you catch things earlier, you get the early diagnosis. You can get the right medical treatment. \n\n\nBoth Knowles and Lewis stressed that the NHIP is still operational and that the current examination is aimed at ensuring its long-term stability and effectiveness in providing universal healthcare.\n\n\nTurning her attention to staff morale concerns, PS Lewis said, "This is why the process is so important, and that it is open and transparent, and that we try to continue to advise staff that what is currently taking place is to ensure stability in the organization and the longevity of the organisation." \n\n\nShe reassured staff that the goal is to create a "conducive to productivity" environment where the NHIP can fulfil its mandate of providing access to good healthcare.

Dr. Michael Darville, Minister of Health and Wellness; Dr. Philip Swann, Acting Director, Department of Public\n Health; Dr. Jillian Bartlett, Senior Medical Officer; Nurse Gina Ferguson-Rose, National Immunization Coordinator; and Dr. Eldonna Boisson, PAHO/WHO Representative for The Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThe update coincided with observance of Vaccination Week in The Americas, April 26 to May 3, 2025 under the theme ‘Your Decision Makes a Difference. Immunization for All.’                                                                                                                                                             According to the Centre for Disease Control, the United States confirmed over 800 cases of measles this year, including a death in Texas, and cases in Florida, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, and Washington. This is compared to 248 cases for the entire year, 2024. In Canada during the first two months of 2025, there were 227 measles cases, with many requiring hospitalizations. Compared to 146 for the whole of last year.  Last week, Belize reported two cases.\n\n“Which is one of the reasons the Department of Public health is having this press conference to alert parents of the danger and the need to ensure your child is immunized,” said Dr. Darville.\n\nHe noted that many of the confirmed measles cases in the US are in states that have direct flights to The Bahamas, which can result in possible imported cases.\n\n“Secondly, the country’s current Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) immunization rates are just under 85 percent which makes us very vulnerable as a nation,” he said.\n\nDr. Darville said he was pleased to report that “there are no reported cases of measles in the country and the Department of Public Health along with our partner PAHO, is launching a community based door-to-door programme to promote public awareness and education programmes about measles, mumps and rubella, and to immunized those children that may have been missed.”\n\nHe reminded the public that measles is a highly contagious disease and the rapid spread is of great concern to public health.  And, he reaffirmed that immunizations are free at the public clinics, urging parents and guardians to review their children’s immunization records.  If they have any concerns, contact the team at the newly reopened Baillou Hill Road Community Clinic or the EPI center at 341-1741 or 341-1766.\n\n“Remember these vaccines have been around for decades. They are safe, effective and are provided free of charge at all public health facilities,” said Dr. Darville.\n\nDr. Swann reinforced the message that the measles vaccine is a vital tool in protecting public health. It prevents measles, a highly contagious\n disease that can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\n“By achieving high vaccination rates, communities benefit from herd immunity, which helps shield those who cannot receive the vaccine due to medical conditions. The vaccine has played a key role in drastically reducing measles cases worldwide, contributing to efforts toward the potential elimination of the disease. Promoting widespread access to the vaccine is essential to safeguarding lives and preventing outbreaks,” he said.\n\nHe added, “We believe that combining these strategies can boost vaccination rates and help protect entire communities through herd immunity.”\n\nDr Swann advised the public that the Department of Public Health is re-launching its community programme. The first wave will be the teams of nurses and nurse extenders who will be wearing Vaccination Week in the Americas t-shirts. And, they would be in communities this week with a blitz being planned for the communities served by the Baillou hill Road and Fleming Street clinics this coming weekend.\n\nDr. Eldonna Boisson, PAHO/WHO Representative for The Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos Islands also stressed the importance of being vaccinated.\n\n“The problem for us is that our vaccination coverage is dangerously low. What this means is that if a case of measles comes into The Bahamas, we are at a very high risk of that case spreading the diseases to the Bahamian population, particularly children.\n\n“We run a very real risk of having a measles outbreak, which needless to say will also severely affect tourism.\n\n“So, what can we do? The answer is simple. Ensure that we are vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine. This will protect the children and prevent spread of this potentially very severe disease,” she said.\n\n(BIS Photos/Mark Ford)\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:09.798628-04	2025-04-27 18:02:09.798628-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/l-r-Nurse-Gina-Ferguson-Rose-Dr.-Eldonna-Boisson-Health-Minister-Dr.-Michael-Darville-Dr.-Philip-Swann-and-Dr.-Jillian-Bartlett.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

In her recent publication, “Been to Cat Island”, the first title in the “Been to Bahamas” series published by Inspire Publishing (Bahamas) 2024, Seymour passionately explores this vital task.\n\nFor many, the prospect of documenting the complexities of island history could seem daunting. However, Ms. Seymour, inspired by the strategic teachings of her late father, renowned chess master Warren Seymour, embraces the challenge. “Archivists preserve and safeguard culture, history, heritage, identity, legacy, and memory,” she asserts, referencing a 1996 UNESCO publication that states, “The loss of archives is as serious as the loss of memory in a human being.”\n\n“Throughout my life, I have heard fascinating stories about Cat Island and from Cat Islanders—stories that deserve safeguarding,” Ms. Seymour emphasizes. “If these narratives are not preserved, they will tragically vanish.”\n\nIn “Been to Cat Island,” readers can explore the unique identity of Cat Island through Seymour’s passionate lens. Discover the origins of icons like Sir Sidney Poitier, encounter delightful anecdotes such as pigs feasting on lobster, and revel in the island’s rolling hills, pristine beaches, and vibrant heritage. This book is not merely a historical account; it is an intimate portrayal of resilience, culture, and connection.\n\nWhile holding a critical archival position at her alma mater, the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, Ms. Seymour remains devoted to\n her Bahamian roots. She aims to ensure that current and future generations of Bahamians cherish our nation’s rich history. When not archiving, Ms. Seymour travels throughout the island and shares her expertise in chess with children across The Bahamas. She is a proud mother of two and a grandmother of one.\n\n“Been to Cat Island” is available now at Chapter One bookstore, Logos Bookstore, Cia Monet, select museums in The Bahamas and bookstores in Canada, and on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats.\n\nVideo Player\n00:00\n00:00\n\n \n\n \n\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\n\nAntoinette Seymour\n\nAuthor Email: antoinetteseymour@yahoo.com\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:17.732052-04	2025-04-27 18:02:17.732052-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Antoinette-Seymour-pic.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

Chester Cooper, speaking at a national briefing on April 15, announced that no further Falcon 9 rocket landings will be permitted in The Bahamas until SpaceX completes a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).\n\nThis decision follows the discovery of debris from a SpaceX Starship test flight in Bahamian waters, which Cooper emphasized occurred without prior Bahamian involvement or consent.\n\n“The Bahamas was not involved in any way with the planning of that rocket’s flight, but we were impacted by it,” he said.\n\nCooper highlighted the success of a previous Falcon 9 booster landing, which was coordinated with Bahamian authorities and drew scores of space tourism enthusiasts to Exuma and Eleuthera.\n\nThe Falcon 9, known for its reusability and high safety record, has completed more than 400 successful landings. However, the recent March 6 launch of the more powerful and experimental Starship—intended for re-entry over the Indian Ocean—ended in a midair breakup visible from multiple countries, including The Bahamas.\n\nThe resulting debris field raised environmental and legal concerns.\n\nAccording to Cooper, the Department of Environmental Planning and Protection (DEPP) is leading the response, ensuring the recovery and removal of all debris at SpaceX’s expense. “None of it will remain in our country, and The Bahamas will incur no cost,” he confirmed.\n\nThe incident has triggered broader scrutiny of aerospace activities near Bahamian territory. Cooper revealed that additional debris linked to three other aerospace companies has also been found in national waters.\n\nThe Office of the Attorney General and DEPP are investigating these findings to determine responsibility and ensure compliance with international treaties.\n\nWhile acknowledging the promise of the commercial space industry, Cooper stressed the need for stringent oversight. “Maximizing the opportunities and minimizing the risks will require a comprehensive strategy, including diplomatic agreements, regulatory enforcement, scientific partnerships, and legal reforms,” he stated.\n\nThe Bahamas remains committed to protecting its sovereignty, safety, and environment as it navigates its role in the emerging era of global space exploration.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:22.668337-04	2025-04-27 18:02:22.668337-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Deputy-Prime-Minister-Chester-Cooper-MOTIA-Acting-Permanent-Secretary-Lisa-Adderley-Anderson-left-and-US-Embassy-Charge-dAffaires-Kimberly-Furnish-at-the-space-industry-update-April-15-2025.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

Alces Dor (Religious Leader)\nDr. Amatti Sani (Medical Expert)\n\nWhile the panel was rich with insight and expertise, the turnout from major stakeholders and the broader community highlighted a troubling truth: the stigma surrounding child abuse often prevents open dialogue. Many prefer the anonymity of online forums of myths, misunderstandings, and unqualified opinions by the naysayers, the hear Sayers, oppositionists and lore-bearers over engaging directly with solutions.\n\nA matter as urgent as child abuse affecting the safety, well-being, and future of our children in the Turks and Caicos Islands, deserves the undivided attention of all.\n\nAs a society, we must collectively commit to breaking the silence, setting aside our differences, and supporting the agencies and individuals working tirelessly to safeguard our children. Child abuse is a serious concern that demands our collective attention and action. There can be no exceptions, no excuses, and no allowances for ignorance of the law or favoritism based on personal connections. Child abuse is child abuse, and it must be confronted with unwavering determination.\n\nInspector Ensa Wilson (Law Enforcement Representative)\n\nThis is a call to action for every citizen, organisation, and institution- Child abuse is everyone’s responsibility, and we all have a role to play in fostering safe, nurturing environments for our children to thrive.                                                                                                                                                                    The Department of Social Development and Welfare remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard the children of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

3	Government And Taxi Association Unite Against Illegal Taxi Operations	2	https://suntci.com/government-and-taxi-association-unite-against-illegal-taxi-operations-p12607-129.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	Local taxi operators and government officials are taking a united stand against unlicensed taxi services in the Turks and Caicos Islands. This follows a recent meeting between taxi drivers and government officials, as well as a formal warning issued to tourism stakeholders about encouraging the use of illegal taxis.\n\nToussaint Capron, the President of the Taxi Association, highlighted in an interview with The SUN, that unlicensed taxi operators have been a persistent problem for years, particularly around tourist hotspots.\n\n"This is an ongoing issue that we have had for numerous years," said Capron. "We have contacted the police department, the director of road safety, and also met with hotel representatives about these illegal taxis that show up in the Grace Bay area taking tourists on excursions to different hotels or to dinner, even dropping them off at the international airport."\n\nThe government has recently begun reinforcing a $1,000 fine for unlicensed taxi operations. However, Capron clarified that this penalty isn't new legislation but rather an existing regulation that had previously gone unenforced.\n\n"The $1,000 fine has always been in the ordinance. It's just that the ordinance was not upheld," Capron explained. According to the regulations, if anyone is caught operating an illegal taxi, they could face a substantial fine, and vehicles not properly licensed as taxis could be towed and impounded.\n\nWhen asked whether the renewed enforcement would effectively address the issue, Capron expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for consistent action.\n\n"In Turks and Caicos, it seems like nothing is consistent," he noted. "If they only come out to do this for one week or one month, of course the guys will back down. But if there is a consistent effort and they really want to get rid of the situation, they will have a team that consistently monitors the situation, and that would be the only way they could bring a stop to it."\n\nThe legitimate process of becoming a taxi driver in Turks and Caicos involves completing TIDES certificate training classes conducted by Tourism Regulation, passing an examination on the history of the islands, and obtaining a public service license from the road traffic department.\n\nAs tourism continues to play a vital role in the islands' economy, officials face increasing pressure to ensure that transportation services for visitors meet official standards and regulations.\n\nEarlier this week, Hon. Zhavargo Jolly, Minister of Tourism, Agriculture, Fisheries & the Environment, issued a strong warning to tourism stakeholders who may be facilitating illegal taxi operations.\n\n"This Ministry stands with every licensed taxi operator who plays by the rules and contributes to the safety, credibility, and professionalism of our tourism industry," said Minister Jolly. "Illegal operators not only endanger lives—they undermine the hard work of those who do things the right way. We will not allow a few bad actors to tarnish the reputation our people have worked so hard to build."\n\nThe government has emphasized that hotels, restaurants, business owners, and tourism ambassadors who promote, refer, facilitate, or enable the operation of illegal taxis are also liable to a fine of $1,000.\n\nAvi Adams, Director of the Department of Tourism Regulations, reinforced this message, stating that "illegal taxi operations undermine our tourism sector's safety, quality, and reputation and pose a risk to both residents and visitors."\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Hotel and Tourism Association (TCHTA) has also joined the effort, with CEO Stacy Cox reminding members that "everyone, from the security guards to the executives, has a duty to safeguard the tourism sector and that can only be achieved by doing what is lawful and right."	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:26.13897-04	2025-04-28 19:12:38.012626-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-53-24-am-6881018.png	By Shanice Lightbourne•	\N

Arlington Musgrove, accompanied by his Executive Team, including Permanent Secretary Mrs Bridgette Newman, Acting Deputy Permanent Secretary Mr Garvin Thomas, Deputy Director of Planning Mr Toriano Williams, and a team of technocrats from the Department of Public Works and Estates Management. The team was joined by Hon. Tamell Seymour, Member of Parliament for South Caicos and Mrs. Yvette Cox, District Commissioner for the Island.\n\nThe purpose of the visit was to assess the state of government-owned infrastructure, explore potential new buildings for use, identify land parcels for development by the government, and address ongoing challenges faced by public facilities. This initiative underscores the Ministry's commitment to ensuring that South Caicos residents have access to well-maintained and functional public facilities.\n\nDuring their time on the island, the team conducted site visits to several key locations, including the Marjorie Basden High School, Iris Stubbs Primary School, the Eliza M. Basden Aged Care and Special Needs Center, various government offices, and the South Caicos Morgue.\n\nHon. Musgrove emphasised the importance of the visit, stating: "Our visit to South Caicos highlights my Ministry’s dedication to identifying areas of improvement in public infrastructure and addressing the challenges that impact the community. By engaging directly with the facilities and its stakeholders, we can prioritise meaningful investments that benefit the residents of South Caicos."\n\nAs part of this ongoing initiative, the Minister and his team plan to carry out similar assessments in Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the coming weeks. Assessments on the other islands across the Turks and Caicos have already been completed, with work scheduled to commence soon. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Infrastructure Development remains committed to working collaboratively with stakeholders and the local community to deliver tangible improvements to public infrastructure across these beautiful Turks and Caicos Islands.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:37.734234-04	2025-04-28 19:12:50.401376-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-20-36-am-2839624.png	Unknown Author	\N
7	Kenneth Walters’ Family Disappointed By Sentence Of Man Who Killed Him By Dangerous Driving	2	https://suntci.com/kenneth-walters-family-disappointed-by-sentence-of-man-who-killed-him-by-d-p12602-129.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	The family of Kenneth Walters is “deeply disappointed” that Bruno Lexima was only sentenced to three years for causing the death of their father by dangerous driving.\n\nLexima, 34, was sentenced on April 8, 2025, to three years in jail for killing Walters by dangerous driving in 2020. The Kew Town resident was also sentenced by a judge in Grand Turk to four months imprisonment for the separate offence of dangerous driving. His driver's licence will be disqualified for 12 months after he is released from prison.\n\nKenrick Walters, the son of the deceased, told The SUN: “THE family is deeply disappointed with the sentence. We felt there should have been a much longer custodial sentence and a much longer period of suspension of his driver's licence after he is released.”\n\nHe added: “No punishment can bring back our loved one, or erase the pain and suffering that this loss has caused. But we believe that a stronger sentence would have been more fair for the taking an innocent life, and would have been a stronger deterrent to dangerous driving in our streets.”\n\nWalters, then 70, of Blue Hills, was fatally struck by a vehicle driven by Lexima on Millenium Highway, Providenciales, around 5:30 a.m. on November 23, 2020. Iveina Henry was also injured in the same accident and taken to Cheshire Hall Medical Centre, where she was treated for injuries.\n\nKenrick said Lexima “expressed no remorse” to the Walters family and they expect he will appeal his conviction.\n\n“We nevertheless pray for him, that God will place upon his heart the willingness to accept responsibility for what he has done and the ability to emphathize with the pain he has caused. We also pray for his family, because we know that this must be a difficult time for them,” Walters added.\n\n“We extend our sincere thanks to the prosecutors and members of the jury for doing an excellent job in this case, and the court for its role. We also thank the many members of the public for their prayers and support during this ordeal.”\n\nWhile incarcerated, Lexima is required to participate in a dangerous driving education program facilitated by the Department of Rehabilitation and receive psychological treatment through the Department of Behavioural Health Services.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:42.166666-04	2025-04-28 19:12:53.032622-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-16-35-am-8688203.png	Unknown Author	\N
8	GOVERNMENT EASES BURDEN ON RESIDENTS WITH PERMANENT ECONOMIC RELIEF MEASURES	2	https://suntci.com/government-eases-burden-on-residents-with-permanent-economic-relief-measur-p12573-129.htm	2025-04-14 00:00:00-04	In response to growing global economic instability and rising living costs, Turks and Caicos Islands Government has taken a firm step to ease the burden on residents by making several key relief measures permanent.\n\nThe decision comes at a time of heightened concern about global supply chain disruptions and potential import tariffs from the United States, TCI’s primary trading partner, which have contributed to fluctuating commodity prices and inflation pressures worldwide.\n\nTo help counter these impacts, government has officially made the Customs Import Duty Exemption on breadbasket Items a permanent fixture. Initially introduced as a temporary response to economic pressures, the exemption will now continue indefinitely, helping to keep essential food and household items more affordable for residents.\n\nBreadbasket Items are now permanently zero-rated for both Customs Duty and Customs Processing Fees (CPF), effective April 1, 2025.\n\nThis means no customs duty and no CPF will be applied to the following essential goods: rice, flour, grits, bread, spaghetti/instant noodles, macaroni and cheese diner; cornflakes/cereal; chicken; canned sausage; vienna; fresh and canned meats; cheese; evaporated milk; eggs; cooking oil; fruits; sugar; instant baby food/juice; water; cleaning supplies (gloves, bleach, isopropyl alcohol (70%), detergent); disinfectants (bleach, hand sanitiser, anti-bacterial soaps); adult and baby diapers; protein nutritional shakes (such as ensure, boost or glucerna); tea and coffee.\n\nA government press release said this zero-rating applies specifically to the items listed above. All other imports will continue to be subject to the applicable Customs Duty rates and the reduced Customs Processing Fee.\n\nIn a further move aimed at reducing everyday costs, a permanent reduction in fuel tax has also been implemented. As of April 1, 2025, the fuel tax has been lowered to $0.64 per gallon. This change is already reflected in the ASYCUDA World customs system and will apply automatically to fuel imports.\n\nMinister of Immigration and Border Services, Hon. Jamell Robinson, reinforced the Government’s commitment to easing financial pressure on households and businesses.\n“These aren’t just promises; we’re delivering real, lasting relief,” said Minister Robinson. “By cementing these reductions into policy, we’re not only making life more affordable for our people, but we’re also strengthening the overall economy.”\n\nHe highlighted that the measures are part of a long-term strategy to make essential goods and services more accessible and to foster shared prosperity throughout the islands.\nThe TCI Border Force has also expressed its full support for the measures, stating its ongoing role in supporting legitimate trade, ensuring border security, and aiding the national effort to reduce economic strain.\n\nThese permanent policy changes form part of a wider initiative aimed at building economic resilience, supporting local families, and raising the standard of living across the Turks and Caicos Islands.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:46.514405-04	2025-04-28 19:12:56.698894-04	https://suntci.com/14-04-2025-02-33-35-pm-9326369.png	Unknown Author	\N

4	Mr. Fitz Bailey Is The Best Choice For Police Commissioner At This Time	2	https://suntci.com/mr-fitz-bailey-is-the-best-choice-for-police-commissioner-at-this-time-p12606-129.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	Over the past two decades, since around 2003, Turks and Caicos Islands has been consistently receiving top-drawer rankings and recognition as a top-tier-tourist destination.\nIn recent times, however, an ugly pimple has been appearing on the country’s international image, with several media reports characterising these beautiful by nature islands as one of the most dangerous places on earth.\n\nThose of us who are privileged and blessed to call TCI home, certainly know better than that. While we are rightfully fretful about the sharp increase in crime and murders in recent years, there can be no doubt in any sane person’s mind that Turks and Caicos Islands, in a very real sense, remains one of the safest places on the planet.\n\nTCI’s unfortunate portrayal as unsafe, stems from a scientific calculation of murders per capita, which it can be argued is seriously skewed. There’s no way that some countries, which we all know of, can be safer than Turks and Caicos Islands. We say no more.\n\nHaving said that, though, the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force and successive governments and governors must, of necessity, take some portion of blame for the current state of affairs. But what is particularly comforting, however, is that when it comes to reshaping and strengthening the police force, TCI now has a British Governor who is finally getting it right, in the person of Her Excellency Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam.\n\nFrom what the public has seen and heard, the Governor has been strategically calculated in her role of taking overall responsibility for crime fighting during these turbulent times. We are satisfied that the correct measures are being implemented to deal with the criminal threat level which TCI faces.\n\nIt is in this vein that we congratulate the spearheading efforts by the Governor in mounting an open and comprehensive recruitment process, to fill the post with the best possible, available person to be police commissioner. It is commendable, too, that Her Excellency went way beyond her personal judgement to include that a broad-based panel, one from the community and consultation with Premier Washington Misick.\n\nThe fact that she courageously veered away from the traditional approach of cherry-picking British commissioners and decided instead to select and confirm “an island man” in the person of Mr. Bailey as Commissioner, the most credentialed police chief which Turks and Caicos Islands has ever seen to date, is a choice which this newspaper whole-heartedly endorses.\n\nWe go further and unhesitatingly and unreservedly commend the interview panels, some of which included Turks and Caicos Islanders, who had played a part in confirming Fitz Albert Bailey, as Commissioner of the Royal Turks and Caicos Police Force.\n\nIt has been pellucidly clear to those who can see, that the Canadian and UK models of policing did not work for Turks and Caicos Islands. Their culture and approach to crime, are simply not germane to what we have been experiencing in Turks and Caicos Islands.\nTo put it bluntly, most, if not all of the past foreign commissioners of police since Mr . Edward Hall left office, have been spectacular flops and failed experiments.\n\nUndoubtedly, those charged with assessing and selecting Commissioner Bailey would have relied on a variety of crucial factors he established in TCI while functioning as Deputy and Acting Commissioner. These criteria would have followed his undoubtedly impressive academic profile and operational record of 37 years in Jamaica, where he rose to Deputy Commissioner, while winning a number of awards and honours.\n\nTo put it succinctly, we believe that our view reflects popular assessment that now Commissioner Bailey represents a welcomed and overdue breath of professional fresh air to this vital institution. For after all, an anxious and dissatisfied TCI society had been subjected to the throes of going through some seven previous commissioners in about 14 years, including one from Canada and three from the United Kingdom.\n\nThis state of affairs did little to encourage public confidence and support to the force, especially when accompanied by a seemingly intractable and emboldened criminal system and culture.\n\nHowever, we do not harbour a completely starry-eyed and naive future for Commissioner Bailey and the relentless charge he is required to lead and manage, against the never-ending drive of those miscreants who are hell- bent on undermining the peace, stability,good order and prosperity that all within our boundaries require, demand and deserve. But we are convinced that the new Commissioner himself is professionally equipped, realistic and experienced enough to cope with the expected and unplanned eventualities that must of necessity come the way of the force.\n\nIn acknowledging his appointment, Bailey used a few ordinary words that perhaps reveal a key to his success both in his homeland and thus far in TCI. In spelling out his leadership philosophy and approach, his vow to work alongside the rank and file should not be seen as a pious mouthing, but instead as a practical furtherance of a operational methodology that routinely finds him on the front line when force confronts criminals on the ground.\n\nThis has already won him much respect among officers and the general public, thereby helping to significantly reduce the “outsider” phenomenon that had bred unnecessary hostility and resistance to non-TCI leadership in the past.\n\nWe are particularly looking forward to a replication of his known success dismantling some of the most brutal and fearsome criminal gangs in Jamaica. Based on his several media interviews, it would appear that refusing to tie himself to his desk throughout his career, was crucial to changing accustomed culture and triggering acceptance, support, respect and loyalty, sharing experiences, listening and learning from others; without which strategy, no matter how impressive in concept and words, will not be fully and successfully realised.\n\nAnd while Commissioner Bailey is well-seasoned enough to know it, the now supporting general public must acknowledge that policing matters will not always go well and according to plan and expectations. However, it is incumbent on the new commissioner and his force to consistently be open, fair, ethical accountable and honest in their dealings with the public.\nFor while this early honeymoon period will not last forever, progress against crime and especially gangs is necessary if we are to protect and build on the social, economic, political growth and development of TCI.\n\nFrom our vantage, the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force is now in extremely capable hands and we have every reason to believe that Commissioner Bailey will perform exceptionally well. We have already started to see some evidence of his commanding, authoritative, firm, humble approach to policing. His appointment has therefore given hope that at long last, people will once again experience the quiet enjoyment of this Beautiful by Nature realm. It must not be made an impossible dream.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:29.889309-04	2025-04-28 19:43:44.966671-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/v4YaCraGR2i_ttWPjhkQJg.png?exp=1745970225&sig=e46ee5b50d366de014675de2276542273dd942f0d670accf40c96da1b88a7bda	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/v4YaCraGR2i_ttWPjhkQJg.png?exp=1745970225&sig=e46ee5b50d366de014675de2276542273dd942f0d670accf40c96da1b88a7bda

The sessions were conducted under the expert guidance of Nikhella Winter-Reece, an internationally recognised Laboratory Technologist Consultant with the European Union Division of Surveillance, Disease Prevention and Control, Laboratory Services and Network.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the EDF Zika Programme has become a beacon of hope and progress for the Caribbean, delivering vital support to bolster public health systems against mosquito-borne threats. Through this programme, countries like the TCI continue to benefit from regional expertise, collaborative knowledge exchange, and state-of-the-art practices, which reinforces our collective ability to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nParticipants in the workshop engaged in both theoretical and hands-on practical sessions designed to sharpen laboratory techniques, improve the availability and use of surveillance data, and strengthen multi-country coordination in responding to arboviral outbreaks. This training not only empowered local health professionals but also reaffirmed the TCI’s commitment to the fight against emerging public health threats.\n\nMosquito-borne illnesses—such as Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever—remain an ongoing global challenge, with over 700 million infections and more than one million deaths reported annually according to the World Health Organisation. These viruses, spread by infected mosquitoes and other arthropods, often flourish in warm weather, making tropical and subtropical regions particularly vulnerable. Infections can range from mild fevers and rashes to more severe complications, underscoring the need for timely detection and effective prevention strategies.\n\n“The battle against arboviral diseases is a shared responsibility,” stated Ms. Arlene Siebs, Director of the National Public Health Laboratory. “Through initiatives like this, we’re not just improving local capacity—we’re building a regional network of skilled professionals who are better equipped to respond swiftly and effectively.”\n\nCommenting on the workshop, Honourable Minister of Health and Human Services Kyle Knowles stated: “The National Public Health Laboratory continues to push the boundaries of diagnostic excellence by embracing cutting-edge technology and fostering strategic partnerships. This training represents a proactive investment in the health and well-being of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands—and by extension, the Caribbean. This workshop underscores the power of regional solidarity and the importance of sustained investment in public health infrastructure. With every training, every test, and every shared lesson, the Caribbean moves one step closer to a healthier, more resilient future. The TCI was happy to host such a critical workshop.”	\N	2025-04-27 17:50:00.876822-04	2025-04-28 19:13:03.532791-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-12-51-12-pm-9478392.png	Unknown Author	\N

All funds raised during the day-long celebration will be donated to support the Trust's conservation and preservation initiatives.\n\n"One of our pillars is sustainability and the environment, so we are proud to put on this event," said Latoya Walkin, Public Relations and Communications Manager for Graceway Supermarkets. "Earth Day is something that we take seriously."\n\nThe celebration featured local farmers from North Caicos, Providenciales, and Middle Caicos selling their produce. Notable participants included Mr. Courtney Missick, Mrs. Gardner, and Mrs. Sylvia Simmons, who showcased homegrown products from her backyard.\n\nJasmine Thomas, Executive Director of the Turks and Caicos National Trust, expressed gratitude for being chosen as this year's recipient. "It means a great deal to us because a lot of the funding that we receive goes to hosting projects and programs for youth in Turks and Caicos Islands," Thomas said.\n\nThe National Trust, a membership organization focused on historical, cultural, and environmental preservation, oversees several important sites, including the Wades Green Plantation, Cheshire Hall Plantation, and Little Water Cay, home to the island's indigenous rock iguanas.\n\nThomas highlighted the Trust's current initiatives, including the East Caicos Project researching flora, fauna, and marine life, as well as efforts to document and protect the Birds of the Turks and Caicos Islands. A particular focus this year will be on developing a youth version of their Birds of the Caribbean Guiding Certification program.\n\n"We are pushing young people to become tour guides because persons come to Turks and Caicos, especially tourists, who want bird guides and even persons in the ecotourism industry to take them on tours," Thomas explained.\n\nThe Department of Environment and Coastal Resources (DECR) also participated in the Earth Day festivities. Amy, a representative from the department, provided educational materials for children, including coloring pages and stickers, while sharing information about whale season and proper wildlife stewardship.\n\nThe event continued Graceway's tradition of environmental partnerships, with previous collaborators including Fortis TCI, the DECR, the Agriculture Department, and the Turks and Caicos Hotel and Tourism Association (TCHTA).\n\nVisitors to the Earth Day celebration could also enter an exciting shopping spree sponsored by Graceway Communities.\n\nThrough initiatives like these, Graceway Supermarkets continues to demonstrate its commitment to environmental sustainability and community development in the Turks and Caicos Islands.	\N	2025-04-27 17:50:06.834749-04	2025-04-28 19:13:07.183303-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-12-39-41-pm-3943085.png	By Shanice Lightbourne•	\N

Officers have maintained direct communication with the Minister of National Security via scheduled Zoom calls, enabling open dialogue regarding any concerns.\n\nMoreover, Commander Julian Smith, The Bahamas’ Chargé d’Affaires to Haiti, has conducted personal visits to the officers to offer support and evaluate their conditions.\n\nIt’s significant to note that the Bahamian officers are not involved in front-line patrols with the Haitian National Police or the Kenyan contingent. Instead, they hold command and support roles within the Logistics Support Area (LSA), as stipulated in their deployment terms.\n\nAddressing claims of overwork, the Ministry confirmed there have been no complaints about workload from the deployed personnel. Discussions with the Kenyan Force Commander reinforce that their work expectations align with standard RBDF norms.\n\nThe Ministry, in the media release, urged the public to refrain from spreading misinformation and recommends seeking clarification through official channels for any concerns related to the deployment.\n\nThe government also said it remains committed to supporting the RBDF personnel’s service levels and professionalism.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:28.086791-04	2025-04-27 18:02:28.086791-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9c348619-8d24-4415-90e1-c9dc5db65a30.jpeg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
42	BNT’s Pig Roast 2025 Raises $100K for Bonefish Pond National Park	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/bnts-pig-roast-2025-raises-100k-for-bonefish-pond-national-park/	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	April 22nd, 2025 – Nassau, Bahamas – The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) recently raised $100,000 for Bonefish Pond National Park (BPNP) during their 2025 Cuban Pig Roast event.\n\nHeld on April 5 at The Maillis Farm, the annual fundraiser drew hundreds in support of this year’s cause: constructing a welcome center at BPNP, which will be pivotal in enhancing the national park’s accessibility; its capacity to offer educational and recreational programs; and its ability to generate sustainable revenue.\n\nBonefish Pond National Park protects the last intact tidal mangrove ecosystem in New Providence. These mangroves act as nurseries for economically and culturally important marine species, like grouper and crawfish; support the fight against climate change by reducing carbon emissions; and protect nearby communities from storm surge. The park also supports many small, local businesses which utilize its resources for ecotourism opportunities – the likes of which will also be enhanced by the construction of a welcome centre.\n\nBNT Executive Director Lakeshia Anderson-Rolle said: “The planned welcome center is poised to transform Bonefish Pond National Park into a more accessible and educational space. It will not only serve as the heart of the park but also as a foundation for deeper community ties and enhanced conservation initiatives. This facility will enable us to better connect people to the natural environment through unique park experiences, fostering a stronger bond between the community and this important space.”\n\nAt the event, she thanked longtime supporters of Bonefish Pond National Park, including Atlantis and Baha Mar – both of whom have a history of donating towards the park and assisting with park cleanings, mangrove plantings, and other initiatives.\n\nAtlantis has donated more than 3,000 mangroves between 2011 and 2025 to contribute to ongoing restoration efforts in the park. Additionally, they have partnered with the BNT to conduct ongoing water quality testing for the park.\n\nBaha Mar has committed to providing ongoing support for conservation work undertaken by the BNT – including but not limited to efforts at Bonefish Pond National Park and Harrold and Wilson Ponds National Park. They also provided a $30,000 donation on the night of the Pig Roast event – majorly jumpstarting the BNT’s live auction in support of Bonefish Pond National Park.\n\nPig Roast is the BNT’s annual flagship fundraiser, and each year it supports a different priority conservation project or initiative. Pig Roast 2023 raised more than $150,000 towards the development of a welcome centre at Moriah Harbour Cay National Park in Great Exuma; and last year’s Pig Roast raised more than $160,000 for the initial development of Seahorse National Park in Eleuthera. At Pig Roast 2025, sponsor Sagoma Construction pledged an additional $25,000 to go towards Seahorse National Park.\n\nInspired by the joyous gatherings of family and friends in Cuba who unite in celebration and cheer, the BNT’s Pig Roast provides an atmosphere of joyful camaraderie. This year’s event invited partners, supporters, and friends of conservation together for a night of premium drinks, fine Cuban-Caribbean cuisine, live music and entertainment, and exciting raffle prizes. The evening ended with a beach bonfire and dancing under the stars.\n\nAnderson-Rolle said: “Conservation is not effective without community. The BNT is fortunate to have a community of exceptional partners and major supporters, many of which were able to join us for this inspiring night. Your support creates impact. Thank you all for your commitment to national parks, the BNT, and environmental stewardship.”\n\nPig Roast 2025 was sponsored by: RBC Capital Markets; Sandyport Development Company; Sun Oil; Harbourside Marine; Bristol Wines & Spirits; Bahamian Brewery & Beverage; Summit Devco Limited, Colina, Grand Diamond, Caribbean Wines & Spirits; Bahamas Waste; Octogone; Bahamas Wholesale Agencies Ltd. (BWA); Marlin Capital Partners; Atlantis; and Callenders Realty.\n\nTo learn more about the BNT’s role in managing national parks, protecting wildlife, and informing environmental policy, please visit its website: www.bnt.bs and follow its various social media channels: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:32.384972-04	2025-04-27 18:02:32.384972-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNTPigRoast2025-018.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

In the past year alone, she has claimed 1st Runner-Up titles in both the Miss Universe Turks & Caicos pageant and the international Miss Global International competition. Her success on the runway, however, is only part of her story.\n\nA dedicated community activist, Selena has contributed to humanitarian causes across the Islands, working with organizations such as United Way and Edward C Garland Yoith Centre and other outreach efforts. She also lends her skills to the medical field, currently serving as a lab apprentice at InterHealth Canada Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nNow, as the face of Turks & Caicos Fashion Week 2025, Selena is once again flying the national flag high. But this cover moment is not hers alone—it’s a shared triumph with the renowned model , runway coach, designer and photographer Kaye Cox, who not only photographed but also styled, directed, and retouched the entire shoot.\n\n“I was incredibly honored to work with Kaye on this project,” Selena shared. “She’s a creative powerhouse and visionary. From concept to execution, every detail was hers—and I’m just so proud we could bring this vision to life together.”\n\nShot on the iconic shores of Providenciales, the editorial captures the essence of island elegance with a bold, high-fashion twist. The visuals, rich with cultural pride and artistic depth, immediately caught the eye of Vigor editors and landed both women their well-deserved spot on the cover.\n\nThis feature is another major milestone in Selena’s journey and a celebration of the brilliant women behind the lens and in front of it.\n\nThis marks yet another milestone in Selena’s modeling career and underscores her continued role as a cultural ambassador for the Turks & Caicos Islands.\n\nFrom the stage to the studio, from the lab to the pages of an international magazine, Selena Grant continues to prove that beauty, brains, and purpose can go hand in hand—with women like Kaye Cox right there capturing it all.\n\nCongratulations, Selena !\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:37.5939-04	2025-04-27 18:02:37.5939-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thumbnail_IMG_0691.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
44	‘People will face consequences’ – VP Jagdeo on Adrianna Younge’s death	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/people-will-face-consequences-vp-jagdeo-on-adrianna-younges-death/	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Guyana, April 25, 2025 – As the nation mourns the heartbreaking death of 11-year-old Adrianna Younge, Vice President Dr Bharrat Jagdeo has expressed condolences to her family on behalf of the People’s Progressive Party (PPP) and called for full transparency in the ongoing probe.\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, the Vice President described it as a “sad day for Guyana.”\n\nHe also made it clear that anyone within the Guyana Police Force (GPF) found to be involved in covering up the circumstances surrounding the child’s death will face severe consequences.\n\nDr. Jagdeo’s remarks come amid growing public outrage and scrutiny of the police’s handling of the case. He pointed to several troubling inconsistencies in the GPF’s initial report.\n\nAccording to that report, Adrianna was at the swimming pool of the Double Day Hotel in Tuschen, East Bank Essequibo, with her grandmother and siblings when she reportedly disappeared around 13:00-14:00 hours. The police initially claimed that the hotel’s CCTV system was non-functional; however, footage from external sources reportedly captured Adrianna entering a red and black Toyota Raum, bearing registration number PSS 4684, which was later seen heading east toward Vreed-en-Hoop.\n\n“If they have that footage (the police) and they put it in the statement…they should immediately release that footage,” Dr Jagdeo said.\n\n“Something is wrong, and we have to get to the bottom of it. We are not going to rest until that happens. And whoever is culpable, whoever, if there is a coverup, people will face consequences; we are not going to tolerate this. This young girl should never have lost her life.”\n\nJust 24 hours after issuing the initial report, the GPF acknowledged discrepancies in the information released and has since launched an internal review.\n\nDr Jagdeo also spoke of the emotional toll the incident has taken on Adrianna’s family, stating, “I saw a video of the father speaking and how distraught he was. The family deserves answers, and the people of this country need answers.”\n\nThe discovery of Adrianna’s body in the hotel pool after hours of desperate searching has plunged the nation into deep mourning. Frustration over handling the case has sparked protests, with citizens demanding justice and accountability.\n\nPresident Dr Mohamed Irfaan Ali has since ordered the GPF to establish a special investigative team to uncover the full circumstances surrounding the child’s death.\n\n“We must uncover the full truth of everything that transpired, and no resource or effort will be spared,” the President said via his official social media account.\n\nPresident Ali also spoke directly with Adrianna’s mother, pledging the government’s full support in pursuing justice. President Ali has further instructed the GPF to compile a comprehensive report detailing all actions since the investigation began.\n\nTo support this, the government has ordered an independent autopsy and Barbadian forensic pathologist Dr. Shubhakar Karra Paul is expected to arrive in Guyana at 5:30 p.m. today to conduct the post-mortem examination.\n\nVP Jagdeo also offered his condolences on behalf of the PPP to the families of Maline LaCruz, who was killed by her husband, along with her mother, Waveny LaCruz and sister, Sueann LaCruz. Maline’s younger brother, Ceon LaCruz, was also injured in the shooting and is in critical condition.\n\nHe said the government is committed to uncovering the details behind the shooting, particularly the legality of the gun used to kill the three women.\n\n“Because if he had a legal firearm, after the assault, he was supposed to lodge the firearm … we will look at this matter,” he assured.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:42.629316-04	2025-04-27 18:02:42.629316-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Arianna-Younge.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
45	Volunteers Plant 300 Trees at Dunn’s River Watershed for World Earth Day	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/volunteers-plant-300-trees-at-dunns-river-watershed-for-world-earth-day/	2025-04-23 00:00:00-04	Montego Bay, Jamaica, April 23, 2025 – In a dynamic show of environmental stewardship, more than 50 volunteers converged at the Dunn’s River Watershed in Bogue Estate, St. Ann, to plant 300 trees in celebration of World Earth Day on Tuesday (April 22).\n\nThe initiative, jointly spearheaded by the Sandals Foundation, Forestry Department and Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB), highlighted the vital importance of conservation in safeguarding the island’s natural environment and bolstering its tourism industry.\n\nThe volunteers, including 35 team members from Sandals and Beaches Resorts and 20 JFB firefighters, planted Blue Mahoe, Jamaica’s national tree, Cedar and Bitter Damsel seedlings.\n\nThese trees were chosen for their adaptability and significance to the local ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                Forest Manager at the Forestry Department’s Northwestern Region Office, Ian Wallace, told JIS News that the exercise not only honoured the environment, but also emphasised the critical role of conservation within Jamaica’s forest reserves.\n\n“Earth Day reminds us of what the environment gives to us and why we must protect it. Bogue II is a 455-hectare forest reserve, used exclusively for conservation and education. Activities like these help to maintain the forest’s pristine condition while engaging the public in environmental stewardship,” he said.\n\nMr. Wallace warned against the illegal removal of trees, emphasising the potential long-term damage to tourism, water security and biodiversity.\n\n“It is important for us to be mindful that whatever happens here in a negative way will impact the coastline very shortly. So it is important for us to understand that negative activities inland will affect the tourism product,” he underscored.\n\nThe event also highlighted the importance of corporate involvement in environmental preservation.\n\nGeneral Manager for Sandals Ochi Beach Resort, Gary Holgate, said the tree-planting initiative, which began in 2017 under the leadership of the Sandals Foundation, has grown steadily over the years.\n\nHe shared that since the programme’s inception, more than 3,000 trees have been planted in the forest reserve, underscoring the organisation’s long-term commitment to environmental sustainability.\n\n“Even during COVID-19 lockdowns, we continued planting. Today (Tuesday), 35 of our team members joined the effort, many on their day off,” Mr. Holgate added.\n\nNoting that the undertaking is “the genesis of real change”, the General Manager maintained that “every company should be part of this movement to ensure future generations inherit a healthy environment”.                                                                                                                                                                                           For her part, JFB Assistant Commissioner in Charge of Area Two, Julian Davis-Buckle, said the event aligns with the Fire Brigade’s broader environmental protection goals.\n\n“For us as firefighters, we believe that conservation of our environment is very important. It helps us as firefighters, because we are approaching the bushfire season and we understand, when these trees are burned and not replaced, the detriment it can have on our environment,” she noted.\n\nFirefighter, Brittania Walker, described the event as a meaningful first for her.\n\n“I planted three trees, and it’s my first time doing so; it felt great to contribute in such a tangible way,” she shared.\n\nEarth Day, which has been celebrated on April 22 each year since 1970, serves to promote environmental protection and awareness.\n\nThe year’s observance was held under the theme ‘Our Power, Our Planet’.\n\n \n\nCONTACT: NICKIETA STERLING\n\nPhoto Captions:\n\nHeader: Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB) Assistant Commissioner in charge of Area Two, Julian Davis-Buckle (left), and Secretary at the JFB Area Two office, Racquel Reid (centre), assist 10-year-old Shanoya Buckle with planting a tree during the Sandals Foundation’s Earth Day initiative at the Dunn’s River Watershed, Bogue Estate, Ocho Rios, St. Ann, on April 22.\n\n1st insert: Regional Public Relations Manager for Sandals Ocho Rios, Lyndsay Isaacs (left), along with (from second left) General Manager, Sandals Ochi Beach Resort, Gary Holgate; Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB) Assistant Commissioner in charge of Area Two, Julian Davis-Buckle, and Forest Manager at the Forestry Department’s North West Regional Office, Ian Wallace, plant a tree during the Sandals Foundation’s Earth Day initiative at the Dunn’s River Watershed, Bogue Estate, Ocho Rios, St. Ann, on Tuesday (April 22).\n\n2nd insert: Forest Manager at the Forestry Department’s North West Regional Office, Ian Wallace (right), interacts with (from left) General Manager at Sandals Ochi Beach Resort, Gary Holgate, and Regional Public Relations Manager for Sandals Ocho Rios, Lyndsay Isaacs, during the Sandals Foundation’s Earth Day initiative at the Dunn’s River Watershed, Bogue Estate, Ocho Rios, St. Ann, on April 22.\n\nPhotos by Nickieta Sterling\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:48.329342-04	2025-04-27 18:02:48.329342-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Earth-Day-3.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
46	Thousands of Students Benefit from Snack Programme	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/thousands-of-students-benefit-from-snack-programme/	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	BY: JUDITH A. HUNTER\n\n \n\nKingston, Jamaica, April 22, 2025 – Approximately18,803 students from183 schools are beneficiaries of the Nutrition Products Limited (NPL) Snack Programme.\n\nThis is bolstered by the NPL Breakfast Programme, which serves students under the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH), which currently supports an additional 50,884 students across another 641 schools daily.\n\nThe Holy Trinity High School in Kingston (HTHS) was added to the NPL Snack Programme earlier this year, and according to the Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth and Information (MoESYI), this reinforces the Government’s commitment to supporting vulnerable students.\n\nThis addition is significant, as it aims to enhance learning outcomes while providing critical nutritional support to students who may otherwise struggle to concentrate and succeed, due to lack of proper nutrition.\n\nThe school is also the first to benefit from the recently launched Grade 7 Academy Programme which the MoESYI, in conjunction with the St. Michael’s College in Kingston, is piloting as part of an initiative to reimagining underperforming schools in Jamaica.\n\nThis initiative is designed to enhance the numeracy and literacy skills of students entering grade seven.\n\nDirector of Communication at the MoESYI, Ruth-Ann Carr, told JIS News that  the Ministry recognises the critical link between proper nutrition and academic performance. So, through NPL, efforts are being made to address the needs of students who may not have access to adequate nutrition at home.\n\n“By providing nutritious meals/snacks to these students, the programme seeks to improve their ability to concentrate, engage in lessons, and ultimately perform better academically. The initiative underscores the importance of addressing basic needs to foster an environment conducive to learning, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed, both inside and outside the classroom,” Ms. Carr explained.\n\nPrincipal of HTHS, Karl Clark, underscored this connection. “Nutrition is not just about survival; it is integral to our students’ focus and engagement in learning. Many of our students rely heavily on the school for food, and we see first-hand how proper nourishment can influence their academic performance,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Education, Skills, Youth, and Information, Senator Dr. the Hon. Dana Morris Dixon, noted the undeniable link between nutrition and academic performance.\n\n“Nutrition plays a vital role in a student’s ability to concentrate and succeed academically. By ensuring that our students receive the proper nourishment, we are giving them the best possible opportunity to excel in their education and close the achievement gap in underperforming schools,” she said.\n\nThe Grade 7 Academy Programme has been described as a transformational project designed to create a robust framework for enhancing student-centred learning and development.\n\nAccording to Mr. Clark,  there is need for such frameworks. “With approximately 500 of our students on PATH, there are many other students who, despite not being enrolled in PATH, also need support and the school steps in to provide lunch for them. The Snack Programme allows us to address their immediate nutritional needs, while the Grade 7 Academy Project aims to create an environment that fosters academic success,” he said.\n\nThe NPL plays a critical role in the National School Feeding Programme, overseeing the distribution of baked goods categorised under Breakfast and Snack. The programme now covers a total of 824 schools nationwide.\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NPL, Andrew Narine, has emphasised the broad impact of  the School Feeding Programme.\n\n“By ensuring that vulnerable students receive the nutrition they need to stay focused and engaged, NPL’s initiative directly supports the MoESYI’s mission to close the achievement gap in struggling schools,” the CEO said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Morris Dixon said the Ministry continues to prioritise the  improvement of  literacy and numeracy through sustained nutritional support, and the NPL Snack and Breakfast Programmes stand as a testament to the collaborative efforts made towards student success.\n\n“Integrating nutritional support with educational progress demonstrates that enhancing welfare is not merely a separate initiative but a vital element in raising educational standards throughout Jamaica,” the Minister said.\n\n“By embracing these programmes, schools like Holy Trinity are not just filling stomachs,  they are fostering achievement and transforming the landscape of education in Jamaica, a journey undeniably marked by the promise of a better future for all students,” she added.\n\n \n\nPhoto contributed\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:02:55.525019-04	2025-04-27 18:02:55.525019-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/meals.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

It is our firm belief that nurturing these skills from a young age will inspire the next generation to excel in all fields of endeavor.”\n\nThe Department of Education expresses sincere gratitude to all participating schools, educators, event organizers, and community partners. Their dedication and collaboration made the event a resounding success. The Ministry remains steadfast in its mission to empower youth through education, arts, sports, and cultural initiatives—building a brighter future for the Turks and Caicos Islands.	\N	2025-04-27 17:50:16.294312-04	2025-04-28 19:13:15.643164-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-12-09-45-pm-1977390.png	Unknown Author	\N
15	Wine Cellar Golf And Fishing Tournament Raises Record $84,000 For Local Youth Programs	2	https://suntci.com/wine-cellar-golf-and-fishing-tournament-raises-record-for-local-you-p12604-129.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	The 14th annual Wine Cellar Golf and Fishing Tournament has set a new fundraising record, collecting $84,000 to support three youth-focused charities in the Turks and Caicos Islands. This milestone pushes the tournament's lifetime charitable contributions to over $500,000, highlighting the growing community support for this annual event.\n\nThis year's funds will benefit three organizations: the Edward Gartland Youth Centre, a longtime beneficiary of the tournament that provides free after-school programs for young people aged 10-18; the CARIFTA Team, the Turks and Caicos Amateur Athletic Association's team competing in Port of Spain, Trinidad; and the Grand Turk Youth Tennis Team, a newly formed program seeking to expand sports opportunities in Grand Turk.\n\n"Every year we seem to be going bigger and bigger and bigger. And it's all because of the support of our community," said Claudine Ewing, a member of the Wine Cellar Golf and Fishing Tournament Committee. She noted that even the fishing component of the tournament, known as "Kolkata," saw record participation this year.\n\nEdith Skippings, President of the Turks and Caicos Amateur Athletic Association, expressed her gratitude for being included as a beneficiary this year. The donation comes at a critical time for the CARIFTA team, which faces significant travel expenses for their upcoming competition in Trinidad.\n\n"This money is needed so badly this year because we are actually going to Port of Spain, Trinidad, and the tickets are extremely high," Skippings explained. The complex travel arrangements require overnight stays in connecting locations for team members, adding to the overall cost.\n\nSkippings highlighted the long-standing relationship between the athletic association and tournament organizer Honorable Galmo Williams, who has been a consistent supporter of the CARIFTA team over the years.\n\nRoxanne Wake-Forbes, Director for the Edward Gartland Youth Centre, reacted with overwhelming gratitude upon receiving the donation. The Youth Centre, which has been a regular beneficiary throughout the tournament's history, provides various programs focusing on academic support, sports development, and creative arts.\n\n"I'm truly honored that time and time again the community shows up and shows their support for the youth centre, for the work that we're doing," said Wake-Forbes. She outlined plans to expand their recently launched soft skills hospitality program and increase outreach to at-risk youth.\n\nThe Youth Centre offers free programs that serve as foundational experiences for young people. "You can say you don't like something, but you don't know until you've tried something," Wake-Forbes noted, emphasizing the importance of exposing youth to different opportunities.\n\nTournament organizers attribute the continued growth and success to strong community involvement, including corporate sponsors and individual participants. The event has established itself as a significant charitable initiative in the Turks and Caicos Islands, with a particular focus on youth development and sports programs.\n\nThis year's addition of the Grand Turk youth tennis team as a beneficiary represents the tournament's commitment to supporting emerging sports programs throughout the islands, helping to diversify athletic opportunities beyond the main islands.\n\nAs the Wine Cellar Golf and Fishing Tournament celebrates its 14th anniversary with record-breaking success, its impact continues to grow, supporting the development of young people throughout the Turks and Caicos Islands.	\N	2025-04-27 17:50:20.76872-04	2025-04-28 19:13:19.290432-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-33-27-am-3725439.png	By Shanice Lightbourne•	\N

"We must lead with clarity, act with urgency, and never shy away from the truth of our challenges," the Premier said. "This is a moment to confront reality—not to be discouraged by it, but to lead change that results in real, measurable growth and lasting national success."\n\nA key highlight of the meeting was the introduction of the newly established Ministry of Innovation, Technology, and Energy —a forward-looking initiative designed to drive digital transformation, foster innovation, and modernize government services. The creation of this ministry underscores the Government’s commitment to embracing technology as a catalyst for sustainable growth and improved public service delivery.\n\nHer Excellency Governor Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam, reinforced the critical need for alignment and cross-government collaboration, stating: "Ensuring we have clear priorities, aligned resources, and strong collaboration across government will be essential as we navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. I look forward to continuing this important strategic work as we deliver on our shared commitment to protect our islands, support our communities, and drive sustainable growth."\n\nDeputy Governor Anya Williams echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the vital role of the public service in driving the Government's agenda: "The public service plays a vital role in advancing the Government's mandate and must remain proactive and forward-thinking. As we navigate a period of transformative change, it is essential that we anchor our efforts in a clear strategic vision supported by a strong operational framework. I was proud to present the public service's five-year strategic vision, which is centred on enhancing service delivery and driving meaningful, long-term progress across our islands."\n\nThroughout the day, each Minister had the opportunity to present their goals and strategic priorities, ensuring coherence with the broader national development agenda.\n\nThis meeting marks the beginning of a series of high-level leadership engagements focused on translating vision into action, emphasizing implementation, innovation, and measurable impact.

In the case of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), culture has historically been rooted in respect, resiliency, a gritty determination, reverence for the rule of law, and above all, a deep respect for human life.\n\nSomewhere along the way, that strong cultural foundation has begun to crack.\n\nThe truth is, our culture has been fractured for quite some time. Trust among our people has eroded. We no longer look out for each other the way we once did. Unity has given way to isolation. Too many of us are willing to fight our battles alone, but not together.\n\nThis begs the million-dollar question: How do we begin repairing the damage? Everyone of us has a piece of the story, if we are willing to listen and can agree to disagree on certain things. We have to reclaim the narrative by our own people, because when outside influence overshadows local heritage, culture suffers.\n\nWe have to be honest with ourselves and each other, taking ownership-even when it’s not comfortable to do so. We need to confront the uncomfortable truths we often sweep under the rug, and that includes examining the residual effects of colonialism and slavery on our collective psyche.\n\nAlthough racism in the Caribbean today tends to be subtle—woven into systems and behaviors rather than overt acts—it still exists. Discrimination based on ethnicity or language continues to divide us.\n\nOne cannot ignore the indelible mark slavery has left on Black people—not just physically, but mentally. That legacy solidified what many call the “crab-in-a-bucket” mentality: the instinct to pull others down out of fear they might get ahead of you.\n\nIn contrast, Black Americans—while deeply impacted by racism—were forced to unify for survival. This unity, born out of necessity, enabled progress. However, even they are not immune to the lingering effects of generational trauma.\n\nEntitlement, often born out of years of oppression and neglect, has hindered the progress of many. But we must understand: no one owes us anything. Our forefathers fought and paved the way. Now it’s our responsibility to rise above survival mode. We are free—let’s act like it.\n\nBehaviorist therapist John B Watson eluded to the fact, “You are the product of your environment,” and this rings true even today. History has shown us that when Black and brown people are given the opportunity to rise above their circumstances, they often excel. The challenge is mental liberation. Are we in the TCI, slowly adopting a mindset of dependency and complacency?\n\nWe are a prideful people, but is our pride getting in the way? We must take a step back and say am I a part of the problem or a part of the solution.\n\nYes, everyone needs support now and then—a handout, a tax break, a temporary cushion. But that support should empower us, not enable. To ensure this, the government must shape policies and invest in infrastructure that allow people to truly “pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.”\n\nIt’s also time we challenge the narrative of success. Not everyone is meant to own a home, run a business, or raise a family—and that’s okay. The American dream should not be blindly copied as the TCI dream. We must forge a vision that reflects our unique identity and needs.\n\nPart of reshaping our culture involves rethinking education. Not every young person aspires to be a doctor or an attorney. And yet, without a vibrant trade school system that nurtures skilled laborers, we are setting ourselves up for failure and will further erode our culture. Diversifying our skillsets will decrease dependency on government and empower individuals to feel in control of their future.\n\nIn the mean time, what tax breaks or incentives are available for employers to hire and train our people, or give those who need a second chance an opportunity?\n\nCapitalism has quietly infiltrated our micro-society and we have allowed ourselves to be caught up in it, from the churches to our way of life. And while it brings opportunity, it also comes at a cost. Freedom is never free—many have paid for it with their lives. We are blessed and must treat it as a responsibility, not just a privilege.\n\nToday, the wealth and income inequality in TCI is vast and growing. Meanwhile, other cultures continue to thrive—often because they work together, support one another, and strategize collectively. In our own communities, we spend more time begrudging one an other than resisting the very systems designed to suppress us.\n\nSo, when will we say enough is enough and begin to change our mindset?\n\nThe time has come for a cultural reckoning in TCI. We must stand together, not just as individuals, but as a unified nation—ready to reclaim our values, redefine our future, and reimagine a culture that not only survives, but thrives.\n\n* Ed Forbes is a native Turks and Caicos Islander, who spent 30 plus years studying and working in the USA.

56	Wymara Resort + Villas Achieves Green Globe Certification, Setting a New Benchmark for Sustainable Luxury in Turks and Caicos	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/wymara-resort-villas-achieves-green-globe-certification-setting-a-new-benchmark-for-sustainable-luxury-in-turks-and-caicos/	2025-04-17 00:00:00-04	Turks and Caicos, April 17, 2025 – Wymara Resort + Villas is proud to announce that it has officially been awarded Green Globe Certification, a globally recognized standard for sustainable tourism. Timed with Earth Month, this milestone underscores Wymara’s unwavering commitment to environmental responsibility, community support, and best-in-class sustainable practices — all while delivering luxury with a conscience, a hallmark of the Wymara experience.\n\nIn its inaugural audit, Wymara placed among the top-performing first-time applicants, laying the groundwork for continued progress toward climate-conscious hospitality.\n\n“Achieving Green Globe Certification is a milestone we’re incredibly proud of — it reflects not only our values, but the collective passion and effort of our entire team,” says Shelley Rincon, CEO, Wymara Resort + Villas. “Sustainability has been woven into our DNA since day one, and this certification affirms our position at the forefront of responsible luxury travel in the Caribbean.”\n\n A True Changemaker in Caribbean Hospitality\n\nWymara Resort + Villas isn’t just checking boxes — it’s redefining what sustainable luxury looks like in the Caribbean. With deep-rooted values and a future-focused mindset, Wymara has implemented comprehensive initiatives that not only minimize its environmental impact, but actively invest in the health, culture, and future of the Turks and Caicos Islands — a destination proudly known as Beautiful by Nature.\n\nThis commitment ensures that the island’s pristine beauty, rich marine life, and vibrant community are preserved for generations to come.\n\nFrom eliminating plastics to restoring coral reefs and supporting youth development, Wymara is proof that luxury and sustainability are not mutually exclusive — they’re stronger together.\n\nPlastic-Free Commitment: Wymara has eliminated single-use plastics resort-wide, including the introduction of wooden key cards and convenient water refill stations located throughout the property, along with other operational changes that remove plastic from\n daily use.\nSmart Water Management: In a destination where fresh water is limited and often imported, Wymara has taken steps to reduce unnecessary water use in landscaping. Rainbird sensors have been installed throughout the property’s irrigation system to provide precise, real-time readings of soil moisture. These sensors automatically suspend watering when moisture levels exceed preset thresholds — helping to conserve water and reduce strain on local resources.\nCommitment to Marine Conservation: One of Wymara’s most innovative initiatives is its end-of-stay donation program, launched in 2023. Since then, the resort and its guests have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, directly advancing coral reef conservation. In 2025 alone, the program is projected to raise over $140,000. Guests are invited to contribute $5 per night, and select menu items donate 10% of proceeds to the Fund. Wymara’s long-term vision is to inspire other hotels and watersports operators across the islands to adopt similar programs — a collective effort that could significantly change the future of reef preservation in Turks and Caicos.\nCommunity Investment: $300,000 donated in the past three years to the Edward C. Garland Youth Centre, directly supporting education and youth development on-island.\nCoastal Clean-Ups: Wymara organizes monthly beach clean-up days to protect the surrounding coastline and marine environment. These efforts engage both guests and the local community and reflect the resort’s recognition that its success is directly tied to the preservation of the island’s natural beauty, including the world’s third-largest reef and diverse marine life.\nSustainable Sourcing: From spa products made with on-site botanicals by The Wildflower Skincare Lab to eco-conscious offerings from 111SKIN, Wymara integrates sustainability into every touchpoint. In the kitchen, menus feature locally caught fish and island-grown produce, reducing the resort’s footprint and supporting regional farmers and fishers.\n\n“The precedent-setting support we have received from Wymara for our coral reef conservation efforts has been instrumental to our ability to expand our operations,” says Alizee Zimmermann, Executive Director of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, the country’s only environmental advocacy NGO. “Coastal and marine ecosystems are culturally valued by the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Wymara Resort + Villas are exemplary when it comes to embodying sustainable practices for all the right reasons.”\n\nSustainability That Goes Beyond the Surface\n\nAs a proud member of Leading Hotels of the World, Wymara’s impact goes beyond sustainability. The executive team champions gender equality, employee development, and cultural connection through mentorship programs, staff training, and partnerships that elevate local artisans and suppliers.\n\nWymara is one of just six resorts in Turks and Caicos to be recognized by Forbes Travel Guide with a Four-Star rating. Now, with Green Globe Certification secured, the resort is doubling down on its pursuit of Five-Star status — blending world-class luxury with meaningful change.\n\nA Global Endorsement of Impact\n\nGreen Globe is the premier global certification for sustainable tourism. Certified members are independently audited based on over 380 criteria, covering everything from energy use and waste reduction to community involvement and biodiversity protection. With increasing pressure on travel and hospitality brands to meet net-zero targets by 2050, Green Globe Certification provides credible, third-party assurance to travelers who care about their environmental footprint.\n\nGreen Globe Certification CEO Birte Pelayo congratulated Wymara Resort + Villas, the newest member of the elite sustainable hospitality community.\n\n“The Caribbean is home to some of the first resorts in the world to achieve certification by Green Globe, and we are excited to welcome Wymara to this elite collection of sustainable hospitality businesses,” said Birte Pelayo, CEO, Green Globe Certification. “From supporting coral reforestation to eliminating single-use plastics and restoring sand dunes and natural ecosystems, Wymara is active and engaged in preserving and improving its holiday destination.”\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:03:50.974093-04	2025-04-27 18:03:50.974093-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thumbnail_image002-3.png	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

58	FORTISTCI RENEWS SPONSORSHIP WITH TCIFA SCORING ANOTHER MAJOR WIN FOR YOUTH FOOTBALL DEVELOPMENT	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/fortistci-renews-sponsorship-with-tcifa-scoring-another-major-win-for-youth-football-development/	2025-04-13 00:00:00-04	Providenciales, Turks and Caicos – After the successful completion of a three-year partnership with the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association (TCIFA), FortisTCI has renewed its commitment to youth football development with the official signing of a new sponsorship agreement spanning another two years. This marks a significant milestone in a partnership that has steadily grown in reach and impact since it began in 2016.\n\nAs part of TCIFA’s continued program development, the current FortisTCI Elite Youth Co-ed Football League will evolve into separate leagues for girls and boys. The Elite U14 Girls and Elite U15 Boys Leagues will launch this year, aligning with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) and CONCACAF competition calendar. The rotation will continue through 2026 and 2027, ensuring consistent development opportunities for national youth teams.\n\nThe new agreement will see further investment in player nutrition, with FortisTCI continuing to provide hydration stations at all league games. FortisTCI employees also volunteer their time to support game-day activities.\n\nThe collaboration continues to foster the growth of both grassroots and elite youth football programs, offering children and teens structured opportunities to develop their skills, stay active, and aspire to national and regional representation. Through this alliance, FortisTCI and TCIFA are not only nurturing athletic talent but also helping to build discipline, teamwork, and confidence in the next generation.\n\nFortisTCI President and CEO Ruth Forbes stated: “Since inception, FortisTCI and the TCIFA have demonstrated a shared commitment to youth football development. We believe in creating every opportunity for our boys and girls to grow through sport—whether they play recreationally or competitively. This partnership created the first competitive youth football leagues across the TCI nine years ago and continues to fuel the dreams of our young football players today. Our sponsorship helps the TCIFA deliver impactful programs with record-breaking participation levels. The success is a team effort, and I take this opportunity to thank the TCIFA, coaches, players, parents and our employee volunteers for their unwavering support of our youth football leagues.”\n\nPresident of the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association, Sonia Fulford-Missick stated: “We are thrilled to extend our partnership with FortisTCI as we embark on this exciting new chapter for youth football. Their steadfast support has been pivotal in fostering an environment where young athletes can excel both on and off the field. We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to FortisTCI for their hands-on involvement, actively participating alongside us during match days. We are providing tailored opportunities for each group to shine and develop their unique talents. This initiative underscores both our commitments to inclusivity and excellence, ensuring that every young player has the chance to reach their full potential. We look forward to seeing our youth excel and represent with pride.”\n\nGeneral Secretary of the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association, Oliver Smith stated: “The TCIFA’s collaboration with FortisTCI is one that is critical for the development of our male and female youth players. Competition is a necessary ingredient in the maturation of any youth player and this sponsorship allows for annual competition at both the grassroots and the elite level. From these tournaments the TCIFA was able to identify players that matriculated to our Youth National Teams as well as our Senior National Teams. Further some of these players were able to earn football scholarships overseas to further their academic goals. This is the type of sponsorship by corporate citizens that feeds and nourishes the TCIFA’s primary goal of developing the sport of football in the country and we once again say a public thank you to FortisTCI and its energetic staff.”\n\nFortisTCI and the TCIFA launched the Grassroots Football League in 2017, starting with over 280 players in Providenciales. By 2018, the program expanded to North and Middle Caicos, Grand Turk, and South Caicos, with consistent growth despite the pandemic’s temporary disruption. In 2020, FortisTCI elevated its support by becoming a Diamond Sponsor through a three-year, $120,000 agreement. Since then, the partnership has introduced competitive leagues for boys and girls and continues to serve as a pipeline for national team selections.

Typically, La Nina events occur every 3 to 5 years or so, but on occasion can occur over successive years.\n\n“For the Caribbean Islands and Belize, such ocean conditions imply increased tropical cyclone and severe weather activity through December, resulting in high potential for flooding, flash floods, cascading hazards and associated impacts,” CariCOF said.\n\nIt said unusual oceanic heat further implies episodes of “oppressive humid heat could continue into early-November,” particularly in the ABC Islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao), the Guianas and the Windward Islands.\n\n“The Guianas will transition from the hot and dry season into cooler and (much) wetter conditions from late-November, except in the far southwest,” CariCOF added.\n\nIt said that as of September 1, severe or short-term drought has developed in Trinidad and worse drought conditions are being recorded in the interior arts of the Guianas. It said short term drought may be possible in Suriname.\n\n“Long term drought as at the end of November is evolving in southwest Belize, French Guiana and Trinidad and might possibly develop or continue in coastal Guyana, the United States Virgin Islands, St. Vincent and Tobago,” CariCOF added.\n\nRegarding the climate outlook for the period January to March 2025, CariCOF said night-time and daytime temperatures, as well as air humidity will likely be considerably higher than usual in most areas.\n\n“Frequent episodes of heat stress are expected in the region and are likely to continue through October in this record-breaking heat season. Heat stress may further ramp up where dry spells are more frequent than usual.\n\n“This period marks the progression of the Caribbean Dry Season to its usual peak by March and the Cool Season. An unseasonably warm Tropical North Atlantic, potentially combined with La Niña conditions is the forecast for this period.”\n\nBut CariCOF said that more comfortable temperatures, though likely higher and with more humidity than usual are forecast for this Cool Season.\n\n“The risk of severe weather impacts from intense shower activity, including flooding, flash floods, and cascading impacts should decrease from moderate in early January to marginal in early March in Belize and the islands.\n\n“An intense Dry Season is forecast for the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Cuba, potentially leading to short-term drought. By contrast, unusually copious rainfall is forecast for the ABC Islands, Guianas and Lesser Antilles,” it added.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:35.365583-04	2025-04-27 18:05:35.365583-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/thumbnail_IMG_5472.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of\n Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.”\n\nIn the 12 years of his pontificate, the late Pope Francis visited 68 countries giving life to a tireless mission to take the Word of God and the comfort of His love to the whole human family.\n\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside at the Rite of Sealing of the Coffin of the late Pope Francis on Friday, April 25, at 8:00 PM, ahead of the papal funeral on Saturday morning.\n\nThe liturgical rite will be attended by several Cardinals and Holy See officials.\n\nIt will mark the end of public viewing in St. Peter’s Basilica, which has seen tens of thousands of people pay their respects to the late Pope.\n\nAs his mortal remains lie in state, over 50,000 people have filed past the Altar of the Confession in the 24 hours since the Vatican Basilica opened to the faithful on Wednesday morning.\n\nSt. Peter’s Basilica remained open until 5:30 AM on Thursday, closing for an hour and a half before reopening at 7:00 AM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Pope Francis’ Funeral Mass will take place on Saturday, April 26, at 10:00 AM in St. Peter’s Square, marking the beginning of the Novemdiales, an ancient tradition of nine days of mourning and Masses for the repose of the late Pope’s soul.\n\nThe Novemdiales Masses will be held each day at 5:00 PM (GMT +2) in St. Peter’s Basilica, except for the Mass on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 27, which will take place at 10:30 AM in St. Peter’s Square.\n\nPope Francis’ coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite held in St. Peter’s Basilica on Friday at 8:00 PM, ahead of the papal funeral on Saturday morning.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:40.792453-04	2025-04-27 18:05:40.792453-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pope-Francis.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

In remarks delivered to the press, the Secretary-General extended heartfelt condolences to Catholics and all those touched by the Pope’s life and message.\n\n“Pope Francis was a messenger of hope, humility and humanity,” the UN leader said, praising the pontiff’s unwavering dedication to peace, social justice, and compassion. He noted that Francis transcended religious boundaries, working across faiths to foster dialogue, understanding, and solidarity.\n\nThe Secretary-General emphasized the Pope’s strong alignment with the UN’s mission, particularly in his advocacy for the poor, displaced, and marginalized. “He leaves behind a legacy of faith and service to others — especially those trapped by conflict and poverty.”\n\nHe also recalled the Pope’s environmental leadership, calling his moral framing of climate action “a responsibility that belongs to every person.”\n\nTouching on Pope Francis’ final Easter message, delivered just a day before his death, the Secretary-General highlighted his call to resist the “logic of fear” and instead embrace “weapons of peace” — helping the vulnerable, ending hunger, and promoting global development.\n\n“In these divided times,” he concluded, “our world would be stronger, kinder, and more united if we lived by his example.” Pope Francis’ death marks the end of a remarkable era in spiritual leadership.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:52.341534-04	2025-04-27 18:05:52.341534-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0649.jpeg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
87	Caribbean Network Operators Group, Turks And Caicos Unveil New Digital Strategies	2	https://suntci.com/caribbean-network-operators-group-turks-and-caicos-unveil-new-digital-stra-p12591-129.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	Turks and Caicos Islands is advancing several critical digital initiatives which were highlighted during the 29th Caribbean Network Operators Group (CARIBNOG) —A “non-profit organization dedicated to bringing together network professionals to look at how we use our digital infrastructure and assets.”\n\nThe gathering, held at the Blue Haven resort on April 8, 2025, brought together regional technology experts, network administrators, and government officials to address pressing issues in digital infrastructure development.\n\nA central focus of the territory's digital strategy involves the establishment of an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), which would transform how local internet traffic is managed.\nAccording to Bevil Wooding, Executive Director of CARIBNOG, this initiative addresses a key infrastructure gap identified during a seminar held in Turks and Caicos in 2019.\n\n"At the time, it was felt that it was a priority to ensure that internet traffic that was going out of Turks and Caicos unnecessarily didn't have to and could be brought back into the country," Wooding explained. "That's something called an internet exchange point, and Turks and Caicos has an interest in establishing one of those."\n\nImprovement in the TCI’s digital infrastructure could not come at a more crucial time, especially in light of recent cybersecurity incidents, including a significant attack on government systems in late 2024. The Turks and Caicos Islands Telecommunications Commission is developing a comprehensive cybersecurity policy framework.\n\nKenva Williams, Director General of the Telecommunications Commission, revealed that the new initiative will mandate the reporting of cyber attacks by affected institutions.\n\n"One of the things that the commission is planning to do is to implement some sort of cyber security policy or legislation, where it has been mandatory that these institutions that has been hacked, they report," Williams said. "Because it's your data, it is my data that has been exposed, possibly been exposed. And we should be aware."\n\nThe proposed framework will include baseline security standards for all local institutions, provisions for network audits following security incidents, potential fines for organizations failing to meet established standards, and requirements for public disclosure of data breaches.\n\nThis initiative forms a key component of the Commission's five-year strategic plan and aims to address growing concerns about data protection in an increasingly digital society.\n\nThe Telecommunications Commission is using the CARIBNOG gathering as a springboard to establish a Turks and Caicos Network Operators Group, creating a permanent local forum for technology professionals.\n\n"The idea really and truly is to establish a Turks and Caicos Networking Operators Group, where you get all of the technocrats in Turks and Caicos come together, have a forum to discuss local issues and come up with a solution on how to address those issues," Williams explained.\n\nThis initiative aims to foster greater collaboration among technical professionals within the territory, enabling more effective responses to shared challenges.\n\n"If one organization gets attacked by cyber security, another organization in Turks and Caicos should not be able to get attacked by the same type of threat," Williams noted. "If they were to meet with each other and say, 'I got attacked by this type of cyber threat and this is what I've done to mitigate these things, these are the measures I put in place, these are the patches that I've installed,' then others can do the same."\n\nRecognizing that technical solutions alone cannot address digital security challenges, authorities are prioritizing public education initiatives. Williams emphasized that user awareness is critical in mitigating cybersecurity risks.\n\n"It all boils down to education. And so we have to educate the users, the consumers of safeguarding and how to protect self. And that is the only way we will be able to fight cyber security attack," Williams stated.\n\nThe Telecommunications Commission has increased its presence on social media platforms to better disseminate information about digital safety and emerging technology trends to the public.\n\n"We weren't doing good at marketing the telecommunication in the past," Williams acknowledged. "But I believe that globalization has changed that... that is why we even started engaging and going on social media to make consumers and all of the stakeholders aware of what is happening in the market when it comes to ICTs."\n\nThese initiatives align with CARIBNOG efforts to strengthen digital infrastructure and security measures across the Caribbean. CARIBNOG, which has been operating since 2009, conducts biannual meetings throughout the Caribbean to provide technical training and facilitate knowledge sharing.\n\n"Our mandate and our interest is ensuring that every territory within the region is properly resourced as it relates to addressing these issues of digital transformation, what's happening with cybersecurity, where is AI," Wooding explained.\n\nThe organization's work in Turks and Caicos builds on its longstanding relationship with the territory's Telecommunications Commission, supporting local capacity-building efforts.	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:21.506385-04	2025-04-28 19:13:42.203366-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-10-32-18-am-6355895.jpg	By Shanice Lightbourne•	\N
88	Inquiring Minds Want To Know	2	https://suntci.com/inquiring-minds-want-to-know-p12610-111.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	When, Where, How and Why?\n\n\nI remember growing up, I was hooked onto a US tabloid called the National Enquirer. The magazine's marketing slogan was "Inquiring minds want to know”.\n\nIn Turks and Caicos Islands, there is so much misinformation or lack of information, that it drives you to have a desire to know what exactly is going. Hence this article is about some of the things that inquiring minds want to know. Why is that happening? How did that occur?\nWhen will that occur?\n\nWhen will the new airport in Provo start construction?\n\nI know TCIG recognized the need for a new airport for the island of Providenciales. An announcement was made from 2021. It's 2025, the same Government is back, but the new airport's status remains unclear. Will it still proceed? Was it tendered? Inquiring minds want to know.\n\nWhat is the compensation amount for the NHIB examiners?\n\nThe government recently fired the board and the CEO of NHIB and brought in an external company to examine the affairs of NHIB. Inquiring minds want to know how much is this costing the taxpayers?\n\nAre Airports Authority and Ports Authority not part of Border Control?\n\nUnder the Administration of 2021 to 2025, Airports Authority and Border Control were under the Ministry of Border Control. The new Minister of Immigration and Border Control does not oversee the Airports Authority or Border Control. Inquiring minds want to know. Are Airports Authority and Ports Authority no longer considered to be part of Border Control? Why is it with Physically Planning Ministry.\n\nDoes it matter if it was one ballot or two ballots for the elections?\n\nDespite 65% of voters supporting the return of the same Government, the Opposition has filed for a petition for the election to be null and void. Inquiring minds want to know why and is this necessary? Clearly, we know the intent of the voters. The outcome would not have changed even with two ballots.\n\nWhat is going on with the hospital contract?\n\nPrior to the elections, there were rumours that the Hospital Contract was being terminated. Inquiring minds want to know the status.\n\nInquiring minds also want to know why the Government wouldn’t invest more locally in the islands rather than spending millions of dollars sending patients overseas.\n\nWhen will the budget for 2025/2026 be presented?\n\nInquiring minds want to know when the budget for 2025/26 will be presented to Parliament for debate. We have the same political leaders and the same civil servants so what exactly is going.\n\nWill there be a budget deficit or a surplus?\n\nInquiring minds are very anxious about the outcome of 2024/2025. Will there be a deficit or will there be a surplus?\n\nWill there be a quota system on country of origin for work permits?\n\nInquiring minds want to know if the Government will continue to allow so many nationalities of one country to get a work permit and reside in the country. Inquiring minds want to know if the Government will implement a quota system?\n\nThe informal settlements\n\nWhile we appreciate the establishment of the informal settlements units, inquiring minds want to know what exactly are they doing and are they demolishing any illegal shacks.\n\nWhen will the first housing project starts.\n\nIn the previous administration, we were told that the first set of development application for housing should have taken place in November of December 2024. Inquiring minds want to know the status of the housing application projects. Do we have developers? Where are the locations? When will it start.\n\nAre we making any progress with finding the criminals\n\nGiven the size of our country, 10 murders can portray us as dangerous. Inquiring minds want to know if any progress has been made in capturing the criminals so that our country can be reported as safe again.\n\nPavement of roads\n\nPrior to the election, a patch of road on the highway was paved and after the election, another patch was paved. Inquired minds want to know why the patches and not a full tender for the entire highway.\n\nHotel for Grand Turk\n\nApproximately three years ago, the Government discussed the construction of a hotel for Grand Turk. This hotel was going to be built by TCIG. Inquiring minds want to know the status of this hotel.\n\nPension plan for parliamentarians\n\nThere were talks that the pension plan would be reviewed and that one will have to serve for three terms before being qualified for pension. Inquiring minds want to know if there will be a change in the pension scheme for Parliamentarians.\n\nReal estate amendment\n\nInquiring minds want to know if the real estate amendment is into effect. Were regulations passed or will this be like how it was in 2003?\n\nWhat happens in TCI happens everything\n\nInquiring minds want to know why some people act like what happens in TCI does not happen anywhere else. I can assure you what happens here happens everywhere else in the world.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am quite sure there are many more issues that inquiring minds want to know. We hope we can get answers for the above issues. Often, assumptions are made due to insufficient communication.\n\n• Drexwell Seymour is a CPA and has an MBA in Finance.

89	Does Democracy Need Overhauling?	2	https://suntci.com/does-democracy-need-overhauling-p12612-111.htm	2025-04-22 00:00:00-04	The idea of democracy and challenges to it, is being discussed now, more than ever. This is because several countries that call themselves democratic seem to be veering in the direction of undemocratic practices, or, as is being said, the leadership is adopting a dictatorial stance both in its policies, and behaviour.\n\nThis leads to a query concerning the nature of democracy, and what constitutes a dictatorship.\n\nDemocracy, in my view, is people power. It is when the people rule as a matter of fact, managing, directing, and controlling the reins of government in the interest of all citizens, and on their behalf based on their needs and desires. This is done through elected representatives chosen by them for designated periods after which elections become routine during which time they again exercise their choice.\n\nBut democracy is also about the performance of elected officials, and their accountability regarding the delivery of the promises they made to make the lives of the people better.\nThe question needed to be posed though is: Does democracy need overhauling?\n\nTrevor Munroe in his book: “Renewing Democracy,” says that while democracy is unquestionably legitimate, existing democracy is equally inadequate, and what appears to be needed is more democracy, not less, transformation, and innovation.\n\nTrevor seems to make a distinction between “legitimate democracy,” and “existing democracy.”\n\nLegitimate democracy matches the ideals I mentioned earlier concerning choice, performance, and accountability, and the institutions that would guarantee this. It is the original intent of democracy as a way of political life. Existing democracy refers to democracy as it is currently practiced or the way it operates.\n\nSo does democracy need overhauling? Munroe describes existing democracy as being inadequate.\n\nThe critics of democracy are of the view that democracy now caters to the few at the expense of the many. They allege that financial capital determines power, not the ordinary everyday people for whom democracy was designed. These critics further allege that democracy is used as a tool to deny, not unite citizens, since a certain type of political behaviour by a particular group, if it does not suit the values, or ideology of the other, can be smeared as undemocratic. So democracy can be used as a weapon to bring others in line with a point of view that is opposed to that held by those who feel their view of democracy represents a purist perspective, while the opposing other is muddled.\n\nThe strange thing about democracy is that even in a two party system which claims to follow democratic principles, one often accuses the other of behaviour contrary to democratic ideals. The aim is to give the impression that it is only one party that upkeeps real democracy.\n\nA further perspective is that in some countries democracy appears to take on the status of a religion. In this sense, other ideologies such as those to the “left” of democracy or even to the “right” are often castigated as evil, or satanic.\n\nThe point is that democracy as a concept has brought division, political strife, and institutional disharmony. Does this and the other perspectives mentioned above constitute a case for overhauling it?\n\nThere is the further observation that democracy acts too slowly in implementing policy, that there are excessive arguments which delay important decisions, and that the current institutions it has to work through are not fit for purpose.\n\nSome political scientists also note that in many instances voter turnout at elections has been fairly low, suggesting voter apathy. They do not seem to feel their voice matters. And even if they exercise their franchise, that everything has been decided in advance. Is this a valid position to take, or a lame excuse?\n\nWhat then does democracy need to do to innovate and transform itself so that its ideals become more relevant to the everyday needs of its adherents, and so stave off its possible slippage into authoritarianism?\n\nTo overhaul democracy, its advocates need to engage in genuine political education concerning what it is about, its principles, goals, and the kind of society that will result from these efforts. In addition, there should be a critical analysis of the way democratic institutions function in terms of decision-making, how success is measured, and communication strategies to determine their success in reaching people.\n\nDemocratic countries that have a history of success in governance should be pointed to as examples of institution building, and their methods studied and implemented with innovations where necessary. A refinement of the concept of democracy should be undertaken, and matched with the social, economic and cultural context of the country which seeks to implement democratic principles.\n\nFrom this, new strategies can be crafted as a political map and guide for the renewal of a real democracy that works.\n\n* Oliver Mills is a former lecturer in education at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus.

79	Statement from Prime Minister Davis on The Passing of His Holiness Pope Francis	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/statement-from-prime-minister-davis-on-the-passing-of-his-holiness-pope-francis/	2025-04-21 00:00:00-04	April 21, 2025 – Today, I join the global community in mourning the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis, a spiritual shepherd whose life was marked by humility, courage, and a deep commitment to humanity.\n\nI recall with great reverence my meeting with the Holy Father. In our exchange, his heart for the poor and suffering, his compassion for the displaced people of Haiti, and his concern for the existential threat of climate change revealed a man of profound faith who understood the urgency of justice in our time.\n\nPope Francis went beyond leading the Catholic Church he opened its doors wider. His papacy re-centered the Church’s moral voice on the teachings of Jesus Christ: love without exception, mercy without condition, and service without reward. He reminded us that the Church must walk with the wounded, speak for the voiceless, and care above all for the poor.\n\nAs the world reflects on his legacy, we remember his call to be stewards of the Earth and protectors of the vulnerable. In the Caribbean, where the impacts of climate change are felt daily, his voice was among the loudest calling for equity and responsibility. And in Haiti, he never turned away from suffering—he insisted we look closer, act bolder, and love deeper.\n\nAnn and I, together with the people of The Bahamas, extend our deepest condolences to the Catholic faithful, to the people of the Vatican, and to all those touched by Pope Francis’ remarkable ministry. May his soul rest in peace, and may we honour him best by living lives rooted in compassion and service.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:05:58.281369-04	2025-04-27 18:05:58.281369-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-20250421-WA0017.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

Acknowledging every role within the force—from tactical and marine units to translators and cleaners—he affirmed the importance of unity and mutual respect at all levels.\n\nMr Fitz Bailey, originally from Jamaica was brought in as a special edition to the Police Force.  He was officially sworn in as Deputy Commissioner back on October 7, in a ceremony led by H.E. Governor Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam; a month later he was named the interim or acting commissioner of police.  Six months later, on April 10, the governor confirmed that Bailey would fill the commissioner post permanently.\n\nIt was a critical spot left vacant when Edvin Martin, a retired police chief from Grenada resigned after five months at the helm of the Force and amidst speculation about his ailing health.  That was last November.\n\n“Following a competitive recruitment process, I have appointed Mr. Fitz Bailey as the next Commissioner of the Royal Turks and Caicos\n Islands Police Force. This appointment signals a renewed commitment to safety, public confidence and the rule of law in every community. The security of our Islands requires bold leadership, modern policing strategies and the development of our capabilities. Having led the RTCIPF as Acting Commissioner for the past several months, I am confident that Mr Bailey brings the necessary depth of experience, vision and determination needed to lead this effort and ensure the safety of our communities,” said Her Excellency, Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam, TCI Governor.\n\nOn Friday April 25, 2025 at the swearing in ceremony held at the Gus Lightbourne Sports complex, Commissioner Bailey aimed for a posture of resolve, touting his work ethic and his faith.\n\nDetermined to confront rising crime and rebuild public confidence, Bailey unveiled a 30-day plan focused on increased patrols, joint task force operations, safety audits, and a visible leadership presence. “This is not symbolic,” he said. “We are a Force in action—not in waiting.”\n\nBailey also called out longstanding imbalances, vowing to address gender inequality in the force’s leadership and champion professional development. He promised an inclusive, modern police service rooted in values, not just enforcement.\n\n“My leadership will be measured by results, not rhetoric,” he declared. “Together, we rise.”\n\nPremier Misick Calls Appointment of New Police Commissioner a “Pivotal Moment” in TCI’s Fight Against Crime\n\nPremier Charles Washington Misick hailed the appointment of Commissioner Fitz Bailey as the beginning of a new chapter in the Turks and Caicos Islands’ fight for public safety, accountability, and trust.\n\nSpeaking at the formal installation ceremony, which was attended by the Commissioners of Police from both The Bahamas and Jamaica; the Premier declared the moment “pivotal,” emphasizing the government’s commitment to strengthening law enforcement leadership and transforming the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force.\n\nCommissioner Bailey, a seasoned Jamaican crime-fighter with over 40 years of experience, was praised for his frontline leadership in gang suppression, financial crimes, and counterterrorism. “This is not a ceremonial role—it is a calling,” the Premier said, urging Bailey to lead boldly, justly, and with measurable results.\n\nThe Premier charged Bailey with restoring public trust, dismantling criminal networks, and ensuring officer wellbeing. He also called for the modernization of the force through education, technology, and capacity building.\n\nAddressing the nation’s officers, Premier Misick assured them of the government’s support, noting that Bailey, having “stood where you stand,” would lead from the front. “The country is watching,” he said. “And we believe you are ready.”\n\nThe speech concluded with a vision of legacy—one rooted in law, order, and lasting transformation.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:06:11.776032-04	2025-04-27 18:06:11.776032-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pIC-01-1.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

During the search, authorities discovered two high-powered, military-style firearms and more than 200 rounds of ammunition.\n\nFollowing the discovery, police say they launched an intensive investigation, pursuing several leads. One suspected gang member has since been taken into custody in connection with the weapons cache.\n\nCommissioner of Police Fitz Bailey described the seizure as a critical milestone in the Force’s crime suppression strategy.\n\n“The seizure of these dangerous weapons sends a clear and unequivocal message—we will not tolerate violence and lawlessness in our communities. This significant find has potentially prevented the loss of life and further acts of violence against law-abiding citizens.”\n\nHe further revealed that seven firearms have been seized between January 1 and April 23, 2025—five of which were pistols. All recovered weapons have been sent for ballistic testing to support ongoing investigations.\n\n“This operation forms part of the RT&CIPF’s intensified anti-crime suppression activities aimed at removing illegal firearms from the streets, disrupting criminal networks, and enhancing public safety,” Commissioner Bailey said.\n\n“Our anti-crime efforts remain focused on high-visibility and intelligence-driven operations. The successes recorded over the past week are a testament to our officers’ dedication and hard work toward achieving our crime reduction targets for 2025 and making the islands safer.”\n\nThe RT&CIPF has pledged to maintain the momentum with continued road traffic stops, search exercises, and targeted operations in areas known to harbor priority offenders and suspects.\n\nPublic Support Urged\n\nAuthorities are again reminding the public of the crucial role they play in supporting law enforcement efforts. Anyone with information related to illegal firearms or suspicious activity is urged to contact the nearest police station, dial 911, or reach out to the Serious Crime Unit at 231-1842.\n\nAnonymous tips can also be submitted via Crime Stoppers at 1-800-8477 or through the Crime Stoppers P3 mobile app.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:06:15.669294-04	2025-04-27 18:06:15.669294-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pic-003.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N

The event was moderated by BSU Business Advisors, Ms. Lashena Simmons and Ms. Judith Guerrier, and was designed to connect programme participants with mentors, business experts, and potential collaborators.\n\nThis dynamic in-person gathering brought together early-stage entrepreneurs, business owners, hoteliers, and key stakeholders to network, exchange insights, and explore strategic support options for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Central to the initiative was Invest TCI’s partnership with DMZ Canada, a leading global startup incubator.\n\nThe morning opened with welcome remarks from Acting CEO of Invest TCI, Ms. Judith Garland, followed by a keynote address delivered by Mrs. Anissa Adderley, Director of the Business Support Unit. Mrs. Adderley reaffirmed the Agency’s commitment to empowering entrepreneurs and cultivating a thriving innovation ecosystem. Remarks from Ms. Alexandra Ali-Dib, Senior Manager of Global Programmes, and Mr. Darren Shivraj, Programmes Lead, both from DMZ, underscored the strength of the partnership and DMZ’s continued investment in developing high-potential startups in emerging markets like the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nLaunched earlier this year, the Accelerator and Incubator Programmes currently support 48 active participants across diverse sectors such\n as agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, creative industries, and technology. By encouraging entrepreneurial talent in these areas, the programmes serve as a catalyst for innovation and strategic sector diversification. Notably, a significant trend emerging across both cohorts is the rise of women-led businesses, which now represent most participants, highlighting women’s critical role in shaping the economic future of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nA key highlight of the event was the “Creating Linkages: A Private Sector Perspective” segment, led by Hon. Tamell Seymour, Member of Parliament for South Caicos and General Manager at Graceway Smart. Hon. Seymour shared practical insights on closing the gap between entrepreneurship and market access, underscoring the value of strong private sector engagement.\n\nParticipants also heard compelling stories from programme members, including Ms. Mary Fulford of Island Mystique, representing the Accelerator Programme, and Ms. Alexa Cooper, an early-stage entrepreneur in the Incubator Programme. Their testimonials demonstrated the real-world impact of Invest TCI’s support and the resilience of emerging local businesses.\n\nMrs. Anissa Adderley, Director of the Business Support Unit, stated: “This event is more than a calendar milestone, it’s a celebration of vision, commitment, and the powerful potential of entrepreneurship in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Through these programmes, we’re not just building skills; we’re cultivating a network, fostering innovation, and shaping a future where local entrepreneurs are empowered to succeed.”\n\nThe event concluded with a vote of thanks delivered by Mrs. Charlene Astwood, followed by a vibrant networking session where attendees engaged with each other, mentors, and partners over breakfast.\n\nInvest TCI’s Business Support Unit continues to lead initiatives that build the capacity of early-stage and growth-oriented businesses through mentorship, funding access, and global partnerships.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:06:21.734224-04	2025-04-27 18:06:21.734224-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_1685.jpg	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
84	The Department of Gender Affairs Celebrates Girls in ICT Day 2025 with an Inaugural Speech Competition	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/the-department-of-gender-affairs-celebrates-girls-in-ict-day-2025-with-an-inaugural-speech-competition/	2025-04-24 00:00:00-04	PRESS RELEASE\n\n FROM THE Department of Gender Affairs\n\n \n\nProvidenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands 24th April 2025 – Department of Gender Affairs, under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Religious Affairs & Transportation, is proud to announce its Inaugural Girls in ICT Day Speech Competition, to be held on Thursday, May 1st, 2025, at 10:00 AM at the Salvation Army Auditorium in Providenciales.\n\nAlthough International Girls in ICT Day is globally observed on the last Thursday in April, this year’s celebration in the Turks and Caicos Islands will take place on May 1st to accommodate the Easter school holidays. The decision allows for broader participation from students and educators alike, ensuring this groundbreaking event is accessible to all involved.\n\nGirls in ICT Day is a global initiative led by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aimed at inspiring and encouraging girls and young women to pursue studies and careers in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). With the digital world expanding rapidly, this observance highlights the importance of including women and girls in shaping the future of tech. It also draws attention to the gender divide in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields and works toward ensuring that girls are not left behind in the digital revolution.\n\nThis year’s theme, “Girls in ICT for Inclusive Digital Transformation,” reflects the growing need for equitable access to digital tools, knowledge, and careers for all young people, especially girls. As countries around the world adapt to rapid technological change, it is critical that girls are given every opportunity to develop digital skills, innovate, and lead in the tech space. The theme also speaks to the role that inclusion plays in national development, highlighting how equal participation in ICT benefits entire communities.\n\nIn this first-of-its-kind speech competition, students from across the Turks and Caicos Islands will take to the stage to share their perspectives on the topic: “How Can Digital Skills Empower Girls to Lead in ICT, and What Role Do Schools and Communities Play in Creating More Opportunities?”\n\nSix schools from across the islands are participating in the event, with student representatives selected to speak on behalf of their institutions. These young ladies are:\n\nTianna Kerr – Alpha Christian Academy\nJeffca Forbes – Clement Howell High School\nAmelia Daniel – Maranatha Academy\nTessenya Pyne – H.J. Robinson High School\nBretanae Smith – Raymond Gardiner High School\nDanisha Decius – A. Louise Garland Thomas High School\n\nEach participant will present original speeches that demonstrate their understanding of the digital landscape, the challenges faced by girls in ICT, and their vision for a more inclusive future. The competition is designed not only to test their public speaking abilities but also to empower them as thought leaders and role models for their peers.\n\nThe launch of the speech competition builds on the Department’s previous initiatives to promote gender equality in technology. In 2023, the Department facilitated school visits by women working in the ICT sector, offering firsthand insights and inspiration to students. In 2024, the Department hosted a dynamic panel discussion in Providenciales, where over 100 girls from across the Turks and Caicos Islands came together to hear from leading women in technology and digital business. These efforts have laid a strong foundation for this year’s event, which raises the bar by giving girls a public platform to share their voices.\n\nThe Department of Gender Affairs acknowledges the generous support of its event sponsors, Beaches Turks and Caicos, COMO Parrot Cay, FLOW, Fortis TCI, and Blue Haven Resort, whose contributions help bring visibility and resources to this vital cause.\n\nThe Minister of Home Affairs, Religious Affairs and Transportation, Hon. Shaun Malcolm, emphasized the critical importance of investing in the next generation of female ICT leaders and the government’s continued commitment to gender inclusion, youth empowerment, and the role of digital innovation in driving national development.\n\nThe Minister stated:\n\n“It is with great pride and optimism that I commend the Department of Gender Affairs on the launch of this inaugural Girls in ICT Day Speech Competition. This initiative clearly reflects the Government’s commitment anchored in the Government’s Citizens’ Contract 2.0 with the people to gender inclusion and youth empowerment. It places young women at the forefront of digital innovation, a space where their voices and talents are not only needed but essential.”\n\nThis year’s theme, ‘Girls in ICT for Inclusive Digital Transformation’, speaks volumes. In today’s rapidly evolving digital age, the future belongs to those who are equipped with the skills, confidence, and opportunities to lead. It is imperative that girls are among those future leaders. By creating platforms such as this, an investment is being made in a generation of innovators who will drive national development and help shape a more inclusive society.\n\nThe Department of Gender Affairs deserves commendation for its continued dedication to championing girls in technology. Past initiatives, from school visits by women in ICT to engaging panel discussions have paved the way for today’s milestone event. And to the young ladies competing, know this: your words have power, your dreams are valid, and your future in ICT is bright.\n\nLet this be a collective effort by the Ministry, the community, and the nation to build a more equitable digital landscape where every girl is encouraged to dream big and lead boldly.”\n\nThe Department of Gender Affairs is proud to champion girls’ cause in ICT and remains committed to creating a society where young women are encouraged and supported in pursuing their dreams in the digital world. The speech competition marks the beginning of a new tradition in the Turks and Caicos Islands, one where girls take center stage in shaping the future of technology.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	\N	2025-04-27 18:06:27.835514-04	2025-04-27 18:06:27.835514-04	https://magneticmediatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thumbnail_image002-4.png	Deandrea Hamilton	\N
303	Carnival Cruise Line abruptly drops Grand Turk citing “operational reasons”	1	https://tcweeklynews.com/carnival-cruise-line-abruptly-drops-grand-turk-citing-operational-reasons-p15006-155.htm	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Olivia Rose•April 25, 2025\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through the tourism industry of Turks and Caicos, Carnival Cruise Line has abruptly cancelled multiple scheduled stops at the popular port of Grand Turk, leaving passengers disappointed and locals concerned about the potential economic fallout.\n\n\nThe cancellations, affecting select sailings between now and June 2025 on the Carnival Vista, Carnival Venezia, and Carnival Mardi Gras, have been officially attributed to "operational reasons" by the cruise line.\n\n\nHowever, growing speculation points to a more concerning issue, a Level Two travel advisory issued by the US Department of State in March 2025, citing increased caution due to safety concerns in the territory.\n\n\nThe decision has sparked widespread discussion and concern, particularly as Carnival has opted to replace Grand Turk with Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic, a private destination operated by the cruise line. \n\n\nAlthough Carnival is offering a $50 on-board credit per stateroom to affected guests as a gesture of goodwill, this consolation prize does little to quell the unease surrounding the sudden itinerary changes.\n\n\nThe US Department of State's Level Two travel advisory, which urges travellers to "exercise increased caution" in Turks and Caicos, specifically highlights concerns about crime, particularly in Providenciales, one of the main islands in the territory. \n\n\nThis advisory has fuelled speculation that Carnival's decision is rooted in safety concerns, despite the cruise line's official statement.\n\n\nCarnival's Brand Ambassador and Senior Cruise Director John Heald, has remained relatively quiet on the matter, offering little in the way of clarification beyond the "operational reasons" statement. \n\n\nThe impact of Carnival's decision on the Turks and Caicos tourism sector could be significant as Grand Turk is a key destination for cruise ships, and the sudden removal of these scheduled stops could have adverse economic repercussions for local businesses and the territory as a whole. \n\n\nEfforts by this publication to reach the Minister of Tourism and other government officials for comments on this development have so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\nAccording to reputable industry sources, while cruise itinerary changes are not uncommon and can be triggered by various factors, including weather conditions, port scheduling conflicts, and construction work, the lack of a clear explanation from Carnival has raised alarm bells. \n\n\nAs travellers become increasingly aware of potential risks, cruise lines and destinations alike are forced to navigate complex decisions that can have far-reaching consequences.\n\n\nThe Weekly News will continue to update the public on this development as information becomes available.

I look forward to continuing this important strategic work as we deliver on our shared commitment to protect our islands, support our communities, and drive sustainable growth."\n\n\nThe Governor’s remarks stressed the importance of effective collaboration to ensure the government’s goals are achieved.\n\n\nHowever, it was Deputy Governor and Head of the Public Service, HE Anya Williams, who brought the focus squarely onto the operational realities.\n\n\nEmphasising the vital role of the public service, she stressed: "The public service plays a vital role in advancing the Government's mandate and must remain proactive and forward-thinking. As we navigate a period of transformative change, it is essential that we anchor our efforts in a clear strategic vision supported by a strong operational framework."\n\n\nWilliams further elaborated: "I was proud to present the public service's five-year strategic vision, which is centred on enhancing service delivery and driving meaningful, long-term progress across our islands."\n\n\nThe Deputy Governor's emphasis on a "strong operational framework" underscores the understanding that visionary statements alone are not enough.\n\n\nOver the years, concerns have been raised about bureaucratic hurdles, resource allocation, and the capacity of the public service to adapt and implement these changes.\n\n\nThe meeting also saw Cabinet Ministers presenting their goals and strategic priorities, aimed at aligning with the broader national development agenda.\n\n\nThe high-level seminar, which marks the beginning of a series of leadership engagements, also forms a key component of Premier Misick's first 100 days in office.

304	TCIG took “proactive approach” to solve NHIB’s long-standing problems–Knowles	1	https://tcweeklynews.com/tcig-took-proactive-approach-to-solve-nhibs-longstanding-problemsknowl-p15005-155.htm	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Olivia Rose•April 25, 2025\nThe removal of the NHIB's board of directors and the appointment of external examiners, was a "very proactive approach” taken by the government to address persistent issues within the National Health Insurance Board (NHIB).\n\n\nThis is according to Minister of Health and Human Services, Hon Kyle Knowles who recently underscored the government’s intervention to address long-standing "inconsistencies" within the NHIB.\n\n\nA bold move to remove NHIB's board of directors and the appointment of external examiners, announced on March 7, 2025, ignited  public debate and scrutiny over the future of healthcare management in the islands.\n\n\nDuring a recent interview on ‘First Edition,’ a Radio Turks and Caicos talk show, Minister Knowles addressed public concerns and clarified the government's position. \n\n\n"The gist of it is really to get down to the root cause of some of the inconsistencies that would have been brought to our attention over the years," Knowles stated. \n\n\nHe acknowledged that while the problems are not new, the government is taking a "very proactive approach to address a lot of the concerns that were brought to our attention from the public."\n\n\nOne point of contention has been why the announcement regarding the board's removal came from the Governor. \n\n\nKnowles explained, "We have to remember, we're a country of laws, and being a country of laws, there are certain practices or certain wording or verbiage... in the legislation that speaks to the Governor." \n\n\nHe clarified that while the statement comes from the Governor, the decision is made by the "government cabinet," emphasising, "It's not a situation where as elected members, we are hands off. It's just verbiage."\n\n\nPermanent Secretary of the Ministry, Desiree Lewis, provided details on the appointed examiners.\n\n\n"The examiners are from a company called Interpath... They have a base... in BVI Bermuda. So they have that regional experience”, Lewis said. \n\n\nShe noted that Interpath was selected after a review of submissions from two companies, stating, "We felt that they would bring a better solution to the table for what we are currently undertaking right now."\n\n\nLewis further explained that Interpath, a "forensic accounting firm," will conduct a review, provide a stabilisation plan, and provide regular updates to the government. \n\n\n"We need to know what is happening at every moment," she stressed, noting that officials are receiving frequent messages from the public requiring immediate responses.\n\n\nThe Health Minister also addressed criticism over why a local company was not chosen for the examination. \n\n\n"Local companies were approached," he said, but "the urgency of what we needed at the time, and the level of or the depth of what we needed to accomplish at the time was readily available" with Interpath. He emphasised the need for "a second pair of eyes" and a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\n\nRegarding concerns that the board's removal has disrupted NHIB continuity, Knowles asserted, "Services haven't been disrupted... that was the premise of why we needed to bring the examiners, because we didn't want to find ourselves in such a position, that services were disrupted." \n\n\nHe added, "When the phone rings for either one of us, that could be a life or death situation. So the time you're going to take at arguing about why this one was removed or why this person's tenure wasn't allowed to go to full extent... the conversation I'm having on the other end of the phone is this person is really, really ill. How are we going to expedite services?"\n\n\nOperation stabilise and rescue \nThe NHIB, responsible for managing the National Health Insurance Plan (NHIP), provides critical healthcare coverage for medical treatments, local and overseas referrals, and other essential healthcare interventions for citizens and residents of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n\nIn a press statement following the Governor’s announcement, the Ministry explained that the "examination” process for statutory bodies is similar to company administration for private companies, where an insolvency practitioner is appointed to restructure the organisation. \n\n\nWhile the NHIB is not a company, being placed under examination under section 39(2) of the Public Finance Management Ordinance serves a similar purpose.\n\n\nThe objective is to stabilise and rescue the NHIB through proper management and restructuring, returning it to financial viability under the management of experienced financial experts.\n\n\nTo facilitate the examination, HE Governor Dileeni Daniel Selvaratnam, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, removed the existing NHIB Board and appointed an Interim Board.\n\n\nIn this vein, the Interim Board includes key officials such as the Permanent Secretary of the Premier’s Office as Interim Chairperson, the Deputy Governor or her representative, the Attorney General or her representative, and other senior government officials.

103	SZA Breaks Michael Jackson’s Historic Billboard Record	2	https://suntci.com/sza-breaks-michael-jacksons-historic-billboard-record-p12561-131.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	In a stunning achievement that reverberates throughout the music industry, SZA has officially surpassed Michael Jackson in the Billboard record books. The acclaimed singer’s sophomore album SOS has now spent more weeks in Billboard 200’s Top 10 than any album by a Black artist in chart history, dethroning Jackson’s landmark album Thriller after nearly three years of consistent chart dominance.\n\nThe historic milestone\n\nOn March 12, 2025, SOS matched Thriller’s impressive 79 nonconsecutive weeks in the Billboard 200’s Top 10. Days later, SZA officially claimed the record outright, cementing her place in music history. Chart Data confirmed this remarkable achievement, triggering waves of celebration across the music community.\n\nTerrence Henderson, president of Top Dawg Entertainment and SZA’s manager, acknowledged the magnitude of this accomplishment. Henderson also noted that much of SOS was recorded at Westlake Studios — the same hallowed ground where Jackson created Thriller. This connection adds profound symbolism to SZA’s achievement, bridging two eras of musical excellence.\n\nThe unstoppable journey of SOS\n\nReleased in December 2022, SOS made an immediate impact by debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The album maintained its top position for 10 nonconsecutive weeks, demonstrating extraordinary staying power in an era of rapidly shifting musical tastes. Even more impressive, SOS has not dropped below the Top 20 since its release — a feat almost unheard of in today’s streaming-dominated landscape.\n\nThe album’s commercial resilience was further validated when it placed No. 6 on Billboard’s year-end Albums chart for 2024, proving its relevance remains strong years after release. This consistent performance defies industry norms, where even successful albums typically experience significant chart decline after their initial promotional cycles.\nBreaking down the success factors\n\nSeveral elements have contributed to the unprecedented longevity of SOS:\n\nProduction excellence: The album’s sonic landscape offers a blend of contemporary R&B with experimental production techniques, creating a timeless quality that continues to resonate with listeners.\n\nThematic depth: SZA’s exploration of vulnerability, self-acceptance, and personal growth gives SOS an emotional resonance that transcends passing trends.\n\nStrategic promotion: The release of singles from the album has maintained public interest, with tracks finding new audiences through social media long after initial release.\nCritical acclaim: Positive critical reception has validated the album’s artistic merit, encouraging new listeners to discover it well beyond its release window.\n\nCultural impact: The album has become a cultural touchstone, referenced across media and influencing fashion, language, and broader pop culture conversations.\n\nComparison to Jackson’s achievement\n\nWhat makes SZA‘s accomplishment particularly noteworthy is the dramatically different music landscape compared to when Jackson set his record. Thriller dominated during an era of physical album sales and limited entertainment options. SOS has maintained its chart presence despite competing with an endless stream of new releases, short attention spans, and algorithm-driven listening habits.\n\nThis contrast highlights the extraordinary nature of SZA’s achievement. While Jackson’s Thriller benefited from massive cultural moments like the revolutionary “Thriller” music video, SZA has sustained her success through consistent musical quality and authentic connection with her audience.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs SOS continues its historic chart run, SZA is expanding her presence in the industry. She will join Kendrick Lamar for their much-anticipated GNX Tour, beginning April 19 in Minneapolis. The duo previously collaborated during Kendrick’s Super Bowl halftime performance in February, performing “All the Stars” and “Luther” to widespread acclaim.\nThis pairing of two of music’s most critically respected artists promises to be one of the year’s most significant tours, potentially extending SOS‘s impact even further as new audiences are exposed to SZA’s performances.\n\nFor an artist who expressed disbelief at merely tying Jackson’s record, surpassing it represents a defining moment in her career. The continued success of SOS demonstrates that authentic artistry can still triumph in an industry often driven by momentary trends.\nSZA’s historic achievement stands as inspiration to artists everywhere, particularly within the African American music community, proving that creative integrity paired with unwavering dedication can lead to extraordinary, record-breaking success.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:12.506392-04	2025-04-27 18:16:12.506392-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-02-02-40-pm-7690062.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
91	The US Tariffs Will Impact All Of Us	2	https://suntci.com/the-us-tariffs-will-impact-all-of-us-p12578-111.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	Be prepared for more increases in prices\n\n\nThe Donald Trump Administration imposed tariffs on countries exporting goods to the USA will impact all of us. The rate is 10% for most countries, but tariffs on Chinese goods can be as high as 125%.\n\nAlthough we don't export much, tariffs will still affect us because we import almost everything and those countries that we import from will be impacted by the tariffs, therefore we can expect the prices of goods to increase further increasing our cost of living.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nA tariff is a tax that is imposed on the goods that are imported from a country. A tariff is like the duties paid to Turks and Caicos Islands Government for importing goods.\n\nThe purpose of tariffs\n\nA tariff is one means by which a country generates revenue. In Turks and Caicos Islands, the Government charges a processing fee along with the duties, In the 2024/2025 budget, it is estimated that the import duties will result in revenues of $112,459,732 representing 24.2% of recurrent revenue. The other custom duties which I think are the administration after is estimated to generate revenues of $38,762,718 representing 8.3% of the recurrent revenue.\n\nWhile the tariff is a way to bring additional revenue, the main reason Trump has introduced the tariff is to protect the US domestic industry. Trump believes that the tariffs will encourage the use of more US products being made locally because the tariffs will make the imported goods more expensive.\n\nThe impact of tariffs\n\nWe should not take the tariffs for granted. Tariffs will raise prices, and some merchants might use them as an excuse to increase their prices, even if they have stocked goods beforehand. Why will tariffs raise prices? Tariffs are essentially taxes, and when added to goods, merchants raise prices to cover these costs.\n\nMany of us also purchased goods from China that comes through the USA to Turks and Caicos and so those goods will be charged a significant tariff. We frequently visit the USA for shopping. If US merchants import goods, it will likely raise consumer prices.\n\nIf tariffs lead to higher prices for goods, it can affect the tourism market as tourists will have less disposable income. If goods are no longer affordable, they will have to prioritize as to whether to make the Turks and Caicos their vacation destination, a place that is already relatively expensive.\n\nIn 2023, the Turks and Caicos exported $21.7million of goods, of which $5.1million were exported to the US. When the goods are subject to the 10% tariff imposed on Turks and Caicos, this can impact and reduce the demand of these goods thus impacting the profitability of TCI exporters.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nWe are also highly dependent on the US, not only for products but for tourism. It is time we truly explore alternatives.\n\nI recently visited Sky Poultry, owned by Mr. Sean Penn. This business has great potential to supply our eggs and chicken. To succeed, our government must review tariffs on meats and eggs to support local businesses. We must encourage more local production.\n\nWe also need to see how we can import goods directly from China rather than having the US as a stopover. This may already be happening, but it is unknown to me. However, if it is not, this is something that we really need to explore immediately to avoid the 125% import tax that US is imposing on China.\n\nWe also need to explore trading directly with Countries in the Caribbean Region and South America and have vessels coming directly to Turks and Caicos rather than going through the USA.\n\nConclusion\n\nI understand exactly what Trump is trying to do, but Trump should know that other countries would retaliate by imposing tariffs on US products. I am not sure that is the answer because it will create a trade war. However, what I do know is we need collaboration and engagement among the Caribbean Region.\n\nFurthermore, our government needs to review our tariff structure. Do we continue using duties as a means for revenue? Do we replace it with something else.\n\nI will conclude this article by thanking the Government for permanently making the processing fee 5% and for reducing the fuel tax to 64 cents per gallon. Of course, these measures have been in place now for a while on a temporary basis. However, consumers continue to face high increases in prices and will continue to do so with the implementation of the US tariffs.\n\n• Drexwell Seymour is a CPA and has an MBA in Finance.

92	Is Cultural Nationalism A Positive Or Disruptive Force?	2	https://suntci.com/is-cultural-nationalism-a-positive-or-disruptive-force-p12581-111.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	In a non-critical sense, culture has been described as the way of life of a people. This implies how they see the world, the influences they are exposed to, what they create, and the different choices they make when confronted with challenges.\n\nBut in a wider sense, culture refers to what we eat, wear, the way we think, and what governs the selections we make. It is also about the way we react to different situations, whether in a calm manner, or aggressively.\n\nVery often we are influenced by other cultures outside our own, as well as the kind and quality of education we receive. This causes us to either give up our indigenous culture, and acquire significant aspects from other sources, or adopt the alien ways whole sale.\n\nIn the specific area of education, this has the effect of changing, even replacing our native culture for that of a socially more powerful group that regards its culture as superior, and any other as having little significance. Further, there are elite educational establishments that subtly pass on the culture of the elite, as a result, the behaviours and outlook of the ruling class are perpetuated.\n\nBut where does cultural nationalism come in here?\n\nCultural nationalism emerged more formally in the post-emancipation Caribbean generally. It implies an historical and current awareness, of the political, social, and economic framework that shaped and continues to impact the behaviour and attitudes that currently exist in Caribbean society. More broadly, the essence of all this was the importation of outside values, the domination of the system by outsiders, the treatment of indigenous persons as if they were non-persons, the unequal selection of jobs which benefitted the powerful and their descendants, and the arrangement of the economy and politics to benefit an oligarchy.\n\nThe people negatively affected by all this, soon recognised their culture, or way of life was being compromised, even threatened. In many instances they demanded their rights, and more from their representatives. They began to develop a social and political conscience, where they began to value themselves as having real power, and see themselves as having the knowledge and understanding to do a better job of governing than those brought from other places. Self-belief also became a factor, along with respect for their music, stories from their pass which told of heroic acts of their ancestors, and the importance of their own local sports in building character.\n\nLearning from the experiences of countries similar to theirs, the Caribbean, including the Turks and Caicos, gained strength, a sense of purpose, and the will to challenge the existing order, using their own strategies.\n\nFrom this, emerged a sense of nationalism, cemented in their original, authentic culture. Cultural nationalism therefore became the strategy of choice for the way forward, and the basis of a national identity.\n\nBut cultural nationalism could display features that were and still are positive, while others are concerning. Some of its positives are that it creates a sense of belonging in society, despite its divisions. This results from shared values and customs, recognition of a common destiny, and a sense of commitment to national goals.\n\nCultural nationalism as a positive force in the Caribbean is shown in its struggles for independence. After its experience of colonialism, the forces of cultural nationalism became more assertive. They took the form of political parties and other social groups formulating cultural and political policies that blended with the idea of cultural nationalism as a force for national mobilization.\n\nThis included an emphasis on designing institutions whose concepts and ideas came from indigenous practices making them more relevant to social needs, and not serving the interests of a particular group or class. Cultural nationalism became the focus designed to enhance the consciousness of society with practices and beliefs understood and practiced by the society at large with support from the new institutions crafted to reflect the ideals of the people, without being taken over and shaped by outside others.\n\nThis meant a new, authentic education in shaping individuals to think and believe they are important, that their ideas matter, that they are capable of creating a society that worked successfully, and could be successful in any area they wanted to pursue.\n\nThis meant they could manage any institution, create new ways of doing things, and that their efforts could match those of others anywhere. With respect to educational institutions, the local innovations instituted could match the standards of those countries that once held sway, and as a result would attract more local persons who otherwise preferred to go to these former colonial countries for their higher education credentials.\n\nThis change of perspective and choice are directly attributed to cultural nationalism, which created a psychological shift in thinking, resulting in indigenous populations valuing their own as being the equal of those abroad who saw themselves and their institutions and culture as superior.\n\nA further area of cultural nationalism is the renaming of street signs to reflect the names of local heroes who contributed to the political liberation of their people. Recently this is being done in several African countries, along with requests to return museum pieces to the countries from which they were removed when these were under foreign rule.\n\nIn the sense noted above, cultural nationalism can be seen as a positive force.\n\nBut there are situations where expressions of cultural nationalism could be seen as a disruptive force. For example, when it is used to assert the superiority of one nation, or persons over the other, and they are treated that way. This leads to animosity between people, and could disrupt relations between countries. Even in the area of sports competition, the victory of the outside team over the local one, or vice versa, is often not seen as one is better trained than the other, but as playing more intelligently. This suggests one having a higher level of brain power than the other. Again, suggestive of this aspect of cultural nationalism being disruptive.\n\nBut even in the area of carnival celebrations which represent a high level of cultural nationalism with its basis in the artistic growth and development of Caribbean people, there is often talk of which one in a particular country has the edge. Healthy assessment gives way to which was better. The fact that each has its own sense of uniqueness is rarely considered. The disruptive element in cultural nationalism seems always ready to raise its head.\n\n* Oliver Mills is a former lecturer in education at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus.

93	Voices From The Streets (Part 50) - The Conversation Continues!	2	https://suntci.com/voices-from-the-streets-part-the-conversation-continues-p12584-111.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	In this week’s article, I would like to share my conversation with Dawshawndre Deane, a promising young man and proud Fisheries Officer.\n\nDawshawndre began our conversation with the saying, "There is more than one way to skin a cat." He believes that the level of crime in our communities cannot be solved by one person alone; it requires addressing the root causes of the complex issues that lead to conflicts between young men in neighbouring communities.\n\nDawshawndre emphasized that a major concern with violence nowadays is the case of mistaken identity and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also expressed his worry that many of our youths are imitating what they see on social media. This, he says, calls for more parental intervention in supervising their children’s screen time. He believes that more conversations can help young people distinguish between reality and fiction.\n\nThe reality is that too many of our young people are turning to violence instead of making better choices. Dawshawndre is a strong supporter of entrepreneurship programs and trade schools. He shared that this is an optimal time for the country to present such opportunities to its citizens, as many individuals can benefit from learning a trade. This will help empower them and teach them how to become business owners, thereby developing our most valuable resource: our people.\n\nHe shared that nothing good in life comes easy, but with the right attitude and the right circle of support, anything is possible. Unfortunately, many people who find themselves ensnared by crime live in communities where it has become a way of survival. Dawshawndre called on the government to provide young people with more opportunities to earn a livelihood so that they do not feel hopeless and without options.\n\nHe expressed that it is time to break the chains of oppression and discover one's purpose and identity. The concept of thugs and gangsters has left many homes broken, many children orphaned, and the graveyard filled with much talent. He expressed that he is a follower of “Voices From the Streets” and believes it is making a difference in keeping the conversation going about addressing crime in our country.\n\nDawshawndre's appeal to young people is clear: the choice is yours; you have the power to think before you act. During our conversation, he shared profound insights into the complexities of crime and the challenges faced by young people. His emphasis on addressing root causes, the influence of social media, and the importance of parental supervision highlight the multifaceted nature of these issues. His advocacy for entrepreneurship programs and trade schools highlights the importance of empowering individuals and providing them with opportunities to succeed and thrive.\n\nHe reminds us that success is attainable with the right attitude and support and calls on the government to create more avenues for young people to earn a livelihood. His appeal to break free from oppressive circumstances and redefine one's identity is a powerful message to all. The devastating impact of gang culture serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for change.\n\nUltimately, his message to young people is clear: the choice is yours; you have the power to think before you act. His words inspire hope and encourage us to work together towards a brighter, safer future for our communities. In our country, where crime and violence often dominate the headlines, he stands out as a beacon of hope and a voice of reason. Keep doing well, Dawshawndre!	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:40.637924-04	2025-04-28 19:14:38.0792-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-09-13-32-am-1218396.png	By Nixon Dickenson•	\N
95	TCI Top Model Set For Glamorous Return After Hiatus, Says Founder Courtney Robinson	2	https://suntci.com/tci-top-model-set-for-glamorous-return-after-hiatus-says-founder-courtney-p12599-129.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	After a long hiatus, the iconic TCI Top Model is making a powerful comeback—and this time, it's more than a revival. It's a rebrand.\n\nCourtney Robinson, the show's Executive Producer and original founder, confirmed the long-awaited return in an interview on Thursday, April 10, 2025.\n\nRobinson, who had been living in the UK for several years, revealed that the show’s rebirth was fueled not by a singular event, but by a collective call from the community and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\n“For years, people asked me to bring it back, and I said, ‘I put that baby to bed,’” Robinson shared. “But after returning to Turks and Caicos in 2021, I realized the creative space we worked so hard to build was missing. There was no real avenue for models anymore.”\n\nWhile the show helped launch careers in fashion and entertainment years ago, Robinson said the impact had mostly been sustained by the hair and makeup professionals who continued using the skills they gained from the experience. But the demand for new talent—and a lack of connection to models ready for professional opportunities—highlighted the need for the show’s return.\n\n“In the interim, people were calling me asking for models for shoots and productions. But I hadn’t seen these talents in years—I couldn’t recommend anyone confidently,” he said. “Then last year, Michelle Swann and I started toying with the idea. I already had the concept, even the script. So I said, let’s pull the Band-Aid off and do it.”\n\nA Show Reborn: Bigger, Bolder, More Provocative\n\nThe rebooted show will now be known simply as TCI Top Model, shedding its original title TCI Top Model Contest and Fashion Extravaganza, though Robinson promises the “extravaganza” energy is very much alive.\n\n“This is a rebrand,” he clarified. “We’re still extravagant—we do things over the top. Fashion should provoke, and this show will titillate your senses. Lights, music, multimedia, the talent on stage—it’s like being in Vegas. It’s a sensory overload.”\n\nRobinson emphasized that this new iteration is not just about fashion—it’s about broadening perspectives, unlocking potential, and delivering a world-class production in the heart of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nBeyond Beauty: What It Takes to Be a Top Model\n\nThe show has already hosted its open casting call, seeking talent aged 16 and up. Robinson said the focus is less on physical perfection and more on potential, personality, and the willingness to transform.\n\n“You don’t have to be overly attractive or overly fit,” he explained. “Modeling is about embodying a vision. We’re looking for people with the desire to grow—girls 5’6” and up, guys 5’10” and up, ideally taller—but most importantly, they need to be ready to learn, train, and represent.”\n\nParticipants will undergo professional development including communication, presentation, and branding—skills essential for thriving in the fashion industry.\n\n“Agencies from abroad are coming here to scout,” Robinson revealed. “This is a real-world opportunity, not just a local contest. From training with recruitment professionals to mastering go-sees and interviews, our models will be prepared for the global stage.”\n\nInspiration From the Past, Eyes on the Future\n\nThe legacy of TCI Top Model lives on through its alumni. Robinson shared that former titleholders like Washanda Registry (2012) and Iberly Abreu (2013) reached out with support and enthusiasm for the show’s return.\n\n“They talked about how the show changed their lives—the training, the confidence. Some even look back and wish they’d pursued it more seriously,” he said. “Their stories reminded me why this matters.”\n\nWith the return of Miss Turks and Caicos after a decade, the buzz for big-stage productions is building on the islands again—and Robinson is ready to deliver.\n\n“It’s time to show what a real production looks like. We’re dusting off the old manual and giving it a new shine,” he said with a smile.\n\nThe Return of a Cultural Powerhouse\n\nAs the countdown begins for its highly anticipated return, TCI Top Model is poised to reclaim its place as a cultural and creative powerhouse—one that elevates local talent, inspires transformation, and redefines what it means to be a model in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\nRobinson summed it up best: “We’re not just putting on a show. We’re building dreams, transforming lives, and giving our young people something real to strive for.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:47.192635-04	2025-04-28 19:14:39.385374-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-01-06-59-pm-3536020.png	By Daisy Handfield•	\N

These students spoke with eloquence, conviction, and compassion as they explored the importance of offender rehabilitation and the transformative power of second chances. The top three winners of the competition were:\n\n• 1st Place: Reriana Nikes – Clement Howell High School\n• 2nd Place: Anique Archer – Maranatha Academy\n• 3rd Place: Damian Missick – Louise Garland Thomas High School\n\nDirector of Rehabilitation, Mr Jaron Harvey, shared his pride in the students and the broader mission of the event: “This competition is a reflection of how deeply our young people understand the issues of justice, rehabilitation, and redemption. Their words challenge us to build systems that don’t just punish, but also restore. Seeing students from every island come together to speak so boldly about second chances and rehabilitation reminds us why we do this work. The future of our country is in good hands.”\n\nMinister of Public Safety and Utilities, Hon. Otis Morris, said: “I extend congratulations to all the students who participated in this year’s competition. You represented your schools and your islands with distinction, and your voices added incredible depth to this national conversation. The theme of this year’s event speaks directly to the heart of justice and hope.\nWe all make mistakes, but none of us are beyond the reach of grace. Rehabilitation is not solely about punishment; it’s about helping individuals find their way back to society as better people. When we support rehabilitation, we address crime at its root and create a pathway for true transformation.”\n\nThe 2nd Annual Speech Competition reflects DRCS’s ongoing mission to change the national narrative around rehabilitation and to foster youth engagement in the national dialogue on crime. As part of the Department’s observance of Second Chance Month, the competition serves both as a platform for student expression and as a call to action for the wider community.\n\nThe Department extends special thanks to all participating schools, teachers, judges, partners, and sponsors who made the event a success.	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:50.453736-04	2025-04-28 19:14:39.873765-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-01-04-18-pm-2787372.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

Rachel Taylor, visited the Andaz Residence Development Construction site in Grace Bay, Providenciales, on Thursday, 20 March 2025, alongside fifteen students from the Faculty of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Turks and Caicos Islands Community College (TCICC), who are pursuing their associate’s degree in building and design technology.\n\nAccompanying the students were the Dean of Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Mr. Kevin Baxter, the Chair of the Technical and Vocational Faculty, Ms Malini Honnegowda, and lecturers, including Mr. Dane Malabver as well as other crucial support team from the TCICC.\n\nThe visit provided the students with a unique opportunity to observe the construction process firsthand and gain invaluable insights into the development process and construction techniques in a professional environment,t as the students engaged with the crew and learn about the materials used in accordance with local building codes. This hands-on, real-time experience allowed the students to connect theory to practice and ask relevant questions related to their field of study and effectively bridge the gap between their theoretical knowledge and its practical application in the industry.\n\nAccording to Mr Malabver, “The students were able to deepen their understanding of key construction principles, design considerations, and project management techniques. The experience enhanced their learning and reinforced the relevance of their studies in the Building and Design Technology programme.”\n\n“The future is in the hands of those who are skill-driven. We want our students to understand that their skills are their most valuable asset—skills pay the bills,” Minister Taylor remarked during the visit.\n\nIn addition, the Minister took the opportunity to discuss potential internship and apprenticeship opportunities for students, both at the high school and college levels. She emphasised the importance of strong partnerships with private sector companies in ensuring a smooth transition into the workforce.\n\nImmediately following the visit to Andaz, Hon. Taylor toured the recently renovated TVET Construction workshop at the College’s East Campus in Providenciales. This newly updated space marks the completion of phase 1, and the focus now shifts to phase 2, which involves retrofitting it with the necessary equipment to support training in various trades.\n\nThis workshop will be a game changer for TVET and TCICC, enabling expanded programme delivery to meet the growing demands for training and certification in the construction and related sectors within the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nAs TCICC continues to strengthen its construction-related courses, fostering these partnerships is seen as critical to equipping students with the skills necessary for success. “We are intentional in our efforts to bring about the desired change. TVET in action at TCICC ensures that our students gain the relevant work experience that will propel them into their chosen careers,” the Minister added.\n\nAt TCICC, the focus remains clear—by providing students with the practical, in-demand skills they need, we are not only shaping their futures but also contributing to the overall growth and development of the community.	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:54.562063-04	2025-04-28 19:14:40.366192-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-01-01-05-pm-4775889.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

Blige is set to make herstory when she headlines Madison Square Garden for the first time in her already illustrious career. The sold-out April 10 show will be a monumental homecoming for the Bronx native— and now fans from around the world will be able to experience it live.\n\nThe For My Fans tour (which also includes Ne-Yo and Mario) has already captivated audiences across the country. Now, Blige will be bringing the deeply captivating show to the world’s most famous arena and the world.\n\n“Playing at Madison Square Garden has always been a dream of mine,” Blige expressed in a press release. “I mean, it’s every artist’s dream, but I grew up in the Bronx. This is my home. This moment really feels like a homecoming and a truly surreal moment.

It’s Mai’s third No. 1 on this chart and her first of the 2020s decade.\n\nShe previously topped the chart in 2018 with her smash hits “Boo’d Up” and “Trip,” which spent eight and six weeks at No. 1, respectively.\n\n“Little Things” is the closing track on Mai’s three-track surprise EP, 3, which she released on her 30th birthday (Nov. 3). The mini project’s other tracks, “Hearts On Deck” and “One of These,” have also impacted Billboard this week.\n\nThe soulful “Hearts On Deck” debuts at No. 2 on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart, while “One of These” opens at No. 3. In other words, Mai currently occupies the first three spots on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart.\n\nElsewhere on Billboard, “Little Things” jumps from No. 15 to No. 7 on Hot R&B Songs, while “One Of These” claims the No. 15 spot (last week: No. 20) and “Hearts On Deck” climbs to No. 18 (last week: No. 21).\n\n“Little Things” is looking to make an impact on the coveted Billboard Hot 100 chart — if sales, streaming and/or radio airplay activity continue to heighten.\n\nThe song has debuted at No. 6 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, which tracks the week’s most popular current songs across all genres below No. 100, ranked by streaming activity data, radio airplay impressions and sales data.\n\nMai’s 3 EP should hold over fans as they await her third album, which has yet to be officially announced. In 2022, the London native released her sophomore album, Heart On My Sleeve. The project was placed No. 10 on Rated R&B’s 30 Best R&B Albums of 2022 list.\n\n“By sitting with her feelings, picking up wisdom from past musical loves, and factoring in astounding production, it becomes increasingly clear that Mai didn’t have a sophomore stumble,” wrote Antwane Folk.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:06.28041-04	2025-04-28 19:14:42.436696-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-02-06-33-pm-2103758.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
102	Sherri Shepherd Heated And Defeated Over Perimenopause	2	https://suntci.com/sherri-shepherd-heated-and-defeated-over-perimenopause-p12562-131.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	Sherri Shepherd sounded off on “the menopause before the menopause,” sharing her frustrations with chin hairs, losing her teeth, and the fact that she can still get pregnant in perimenopause.\n\n“My anatomy is still playing tricks on me. Like, every time I go to the doctor, and I think we've got it figured out, something else comes up,” Shepherd said on the March 27 episode of Sherri. She explained that she’s been getting hot flashes and assumed she was going through menopause — but shared that “my doctor gave me the most shocking news: She told me I was in perimenopause.”\n\n“When she said perimenopause, I thought that she meant I was being very demure and mindful — in perimenopause — because I thought I was handling menopause well,” The View alum, 57, said.\n\nMenopause, as her executive producer Jawn Murray said, is when “y'all get a little mean. At least my mama did” — which prompted Shepherd to say “we take a lot of umbrage when you say we 'get mean.' It's just our hormones are changing and things... it's estrogen, it's testosterone. And we're trying to figure out where we fit in this new body.”\nMenopause, the Mayo Clinic explains, is when menstruation stops — and the time leading up to it, perimenopause, can cause irregular periods, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes and problems with sleep.\n\nOr, as Shepherd explained, perimenopause is “the menopause before the menopause …. if what I'm going through right now is perimenopause, what the hell is the real menopause? You tell me... what is a peri-hot flash?”\n\nShe said that “I've been blaming all of my chin hairs on menopause. Fellas, if you get with a woman my age, and there's a lot of chin hairs, that's menopause. We don't come out going, 'Look at all this hair on my chin.' But by the time the real menopause gets here, I swear I'm gonna look like Sasquatch from the chin up.”\n\nShe also shared she lost a tooth “due to the menopause,” explaining “I lost my Queen Latootha,” and bemoaned that she’s going to be “nothing but gums” by the time "menopause gets here.” This is because, the National Library of Medicine explains, "The teeth and gums are extremely susceptible to any hormonal changes that take place just before menopause."\n\nAnd because she’s still menstruating, “I can still get pregnant," Shepherd said. "Oh my goodness.”\n\n“I don't know what this is,” she said. “I [have to] hurry up and get to post-menopause because I'm heated and defeated.”\n\nShe explained that she'd previously thought she would never have to tell a sexual partner “we need to talk” due to a pregnancy scare, but as she explained, “It turns out, absolutely, I can make that call. I went out with a man... We went out a few times, …, I was like, 'Get ready sir. I might be calling you soon. We may need to talk.’ “\n\n“There's just nothing good about it here in this season of my life,” she said. “So ladies don't let the age fool [you], ‘cause you can still get pregnant.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:09.728868-04	2025-04-28 19:14:44.130308-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-02-04-34-pm-588163.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

IMO is slang for “in my opinion.”\n\nSome of the guests slated to speak to the former first lady and Robinson, the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, include the actors Issa Rae and Keke Palmer and psychologist Dr. Orna Guralnik.\n\nOther guests include filmmakers Seth and Lauren Rogan; soccer star Abby Wambach; authors Jay Shetty, Glennon Doyle and Logan Ury; editor Elaine Welteroth; radio personality Angie Martinez; media mogul Tyler Perry; actor Tracee Ellis Ross; husband-and-wife athlete and actor Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union; and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nThe first two episodes — the first is an introductory one and the second features Rae — will premiere on March 12. New episodes will be released weekly and will be available on all audio platforms and YouTube.\n\n“With everything going on in the world, we’re all looking for answers and people to turn to,” Obama said in a statement. “There is no single way to deal with the challenges we may be facing — whether it’s family, faith, or our personal relationships — but taking the time to open up and talk about these issues can provide hope.”\n\nObama has had two other podcasts — “The Michelle Obama Podcast” in 2020 and another in 2023, “The Light We Carry.” Her husband, Barack Obama, offered a series of conversations about American life between him and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe new podcast is a production of Higher Ground, the media company founded in 2018 by the former president and first lady.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:18.526861-04	2025-04-28 19:14:54.746684-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-55-20-pm-2550883.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

He’s not surface. He will never say anything and just leave it there with a full stop. He will have the entire history: the energy, the time, the month that it is,” she added.\n\nThe name Riot also has a musical connection as A$AP Rocky collaborated with Williams on the track “Riot (Rowdy Pipe’n).”\n\nRihanna also reflected on Rocky as a dad, telling Harper’s Bazaar that the “greatest thing” about him is seeing him be a dad. His pureness. His charm.”\n\nShe added: “I’m annoyed because my sons sometimes just live for him more than they live for me. And I’m like, ‘Did you know who cooked you? Do you know who pushed you out?’ And they love him, but when I see it, oh, it’s the best.”\n\nAs her sons have grown, Rihanna reflected on what personality traits she has begun to see in them. “RZA is just an empath,” she said about her older son.\n\n“He’s so magical. He loves music. He loves melody. He loves books. He loves water. Bath time, swimming, pool, beach, anything,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, she described Riot as “hilarious” and someone who always “wants to sing.”\n“When he wakes up, he starts to squeal, scream. Not in a crying way. He just wants to sing,” she said.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:21.384568-04	2025-04-28 19:14:58.420346-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-52-34-pm-5181403.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
107	Lauryn Hill And Stevie Wonder Delight At Roberta Flack’s ‘Celebration Of Life’ Memorial	2	https://suntci.com/lauryn-hill-and-stevie-wonder-delight-at-roberta-flacks-celebration-of-li-p12456-131.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	NEW YORK — A public memorial service bursting with music, including planned performances by Stevie Wonder and a surprise one by Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, celebrated the life and legacy of the Grammy-winning singer and pianist Roberta Flack.\n\nFlack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died last month at age 88.\n\nShe’s best-known for her transformative covers of “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” and “Killing Me Softly With His Song.” Both were expertly handled by Hill at the ceremony held Monday afternoon at New York’s Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nWonder followed the set and the Rev. Al Sharpton gave the eulogy.\n\nFlack “put a soundtrack to Black dignity,” Sharpton said.\n\nAs many said in their tributes, Flack’s musical genius stemmed from her ability to seamlessly move between soul, jazz, gospel and beyond.\n\nHer “Celebration of Life” memorial was livestreamed at www.RobertaFlack.com and on YouTube.\n\nFor the memory of a singing legend, a historic location\n\nFlack’s memorial was open to the public at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a historic Harlem institution. Founded in 1808, it is one of the oldest Black Baptist churches in the U.S.\n\nThe church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets. Seats filled quickly. At center, a screen showed a young Flack at the piano and played highlights of her career. Later, it would broadcast music industry legends paying tribute to Flack, including Clive Davis,Dionne Warwick, India.Arie and Alicia Keys.\n\nIt was a fitting location for such a celebration: Flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano.\n\nThe ceremony detoured from a program handed out to attendees. It featured a powerful quote from Flack on the back that Arie would include in her message.\n\n“Remember: Always walk in the light,” Flack once said. “If you feel like you’re not walking in it, go find it. Love the Light.”\n\nCelebrating a life in music — through music\n\n“Her existence was a form of resistance,” Hill said in her speech, holding back tears.\nHill’s appearance was unexpected but fitting. In the 1990s, her hip-hop trio the Fugees did a masterful take on Flack’s cover “Killing Me Softly With His Song.” It won the group a Grammy, two decades after Flack took home the record of the year trophy for the song.\n“I adore Ms. Roberta Flack,” she said. “Roberta Flack is legend.”\n\nShe then launched into a cover of “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” followed by “Killing Me Softly With His Song” with the Fugees’ Wyclef Jean — and Wonder joining in on harmonica.\n\nA legend who needed no introduction but certainly received one with roaring applause, Wonder followed up.\n\n“The great thing about not having the ability to see with your eyes is the great opportunity of being able to even better see with your heart. And so I knew how beautiful Roberta was, not seeing her visually but being able to see and feel her heart,” Wonder said.\n\nHe performed his song “If It’s Magic,” accompanied only by a harpist. Then he sat at the piano to sing with the harpist a song he wrote for Flack, “I Can See the Sun in Late December.”\n\n“I love you, Roberta. And I will see you,” Wonder said at the end.\n\nEarlier, songwriter and performer Valerie Simpson of Ashford & Simpson played piano and sang an extended take of “Ain’t Nothing Like the Real Thing” interspersed with recollections of her friend.\n\n“But that voice. Aw, she’d just grab you in the heart. And then when she touched the keys, she knew how to dig down deep,” Simpson said.\n\nSimpson recalled being tapped to perform in “Chicago” for her 2018 Broadway debut and how she told Flack she wasn’t sure if she could act.\n\n“She looked at me and said, ‘Girl, where’s the script? Bring it over here. We’re going to work on this thing. We’re going to do this,’” remembered Simpson.\n\nNew Orleans singer and piano player Davell Crawford performed a soulful version of Flack’s song “Just When I Needed You” to celebratory shouts and cheers.\n\nA legendary artist remembered\n\n“Many of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts but she also touched our souls,” said the Rev. Dr. Kevin R. Johnson, the senior church pastor who led the service.\n\nChoir performances including a rousing rendition of “Amazing Grace” came in between a video recollection of Flack’s life and scripture readings.\n\n“The reason we’re here is because she made a difference,” Sharpton said. And we should all ask ourselves when it comes our time, will they pack a church for you? If Roberta were here tonight, she would tell you, ‘Don’t just praise me, emulate me.’”\n\nActor Phylicia Rashad remembered first seeing Flack perform when she was a student at Howard University — to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet, steady voice.\n\nFlack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people, Rashad said.\n\n“She wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most: music, love and humanity,” Rashad said.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:24.442261-04	2025-04-28 19:15:05.307318-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-50-44-pm-7573481.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

But he instead found himself literally leaping with joy into the lap of his superstar partner Rihanna in the audience behind him.\n\n“There was a moment when, before we heard the words from the clerk, he didn’t know if he was going to be spending the next two decades in jail or going home,” his attorney Joe Tacopina said.\n\nRocky had a banner year of fame and glamour in the works that he can now freely embrace.\n\nIn the same city as his acquittal, he is set to bask in the height of hip-hop as headliner of the Rolling Loud music festival next month. On the other coast, he’ll be at the height of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, as a celebrity co-chair along with LeBron James and Pharrell Williams in May. And in summer, he adds major motion picture actor to his resume as the co-star — with Denzel Washington — in director Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest.”\n\nThe trial arguably came at the height of his fame, if not the pinnacle of a music career that began with acclaim in his native New York and later led to a pair of No. 1 albums and three Grammy nominations.\n\nIt would have been very easy — and many would say smart — for him to have accepted a relatively generous pretrial offer: Just six months in jail, along with probation and other conditions, for a guilty plea to one count.\n\nHe declined, and said bring it on to a three-week trial and the possibility of a prison sentence of up to 24 years and spending the foreseeable future away from Rihanna and their children, 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers\n“He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,” Tacopina said. “They’re gonna move on. they have a lot of great things professionally going on. Rocky’s really at the height of his career. Rihanna’s on top of the world. They have two beautiful children. They have a family.”\n\nRocky and Rihanna pushed their way through a crush of photographers, reporters, YouTubers and fans to get into a waiting SUV.\n\n“I’m thankful ... to be here right now, to be a free man talking to y’all,” he said with a smile.\nWhen the verdict was read a few minutes earlier, the courtroom full of fans exploded into screaming glee as Rocky jumped to where Rihanna sat with his mother and sister.\n\n“Mr. Mayers, you’re excused,” Judge Mark Arnold said moments later, with the post-trial hearings, appeals and sentencing now nonexistent.\n\nRihanna had slipped into the courtroom after the rest of the audience was seated, as she did several times during the three-week trial, bringing their sons with her to closing arguments.\n\nRocky had been more than 30 minutes late for the reading of the verdict, and looked shaken and tense as he waited for it.\n\nThen came the verdict, the leap, and the release.\n\n“I didn’t know how athletic he was,” Tacopina said. “That was raw emotion, you guys got to see.”\n\nProsecutors and their witnesses said Rocky was beefing with a former friend, A$AP Relli, with whom he had been in a crew who called themselves the A$AP Mob since high school. They said the two men met up in Hollywood on Nov. 6, 2021, and after a scuffle that also included their high school mates A$AP Twelvyy and A$AP Illz, Rocky pulled the gun and fired twice at Relli, who said one of the shots grazed his knuckle but was not seriously hurt.\n\nRocky’s lawyers and witnesses they called said Rocky had shot a prop gun that only fires blanks, which he had been carrying for security since taking it from a music video set months earlier. They cast Relli as a lying opportunist who had only gone to police because he was seeking Rocky’s money. He has filed a separate civil suit that is pending.\nThe jurors were also instructed that if they found that Rocky reasonably believed that he or one of the two friends with him that night were in imminent danger of injury, and that he used reasonable force, they could find the defendant not guilty.\n\nIt’s not clear which path to acquittal the jurors took in clearing him, only that they did not accept the prosecution’s case. They reached their unanimous conclusion in just three hours.\n\n“This jury saw through it and came to an enormously quick and speedy verdict, the right verdict,” Tacopina said.\n\nRocky said outside court that after getting him off, Tacopina, whose other clients have included baseball great Alex Rodriguez and President Donald Trump, should join his crew.\n\n“A$AP Joe!” he shouted.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman said he respected the jury’s decision.\n\n“Our office remains committed to seeking accountability for those who break the law, no matter their status or influence,” Hochman said in a statement. “Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:28.209928-04	2025-04-28 19:15:12.389379-04	https://suntci.com/25-02-2025-12-19-14-pm-155306.png	Unknown Author	\N
109	Nevada Judge Reschedules Trial For The Suspect In Tupac Shakur’s 1996 Killing For Next Year	2	https://suntci.com/nevada-judge-reschedules-trial-for-the-suspect-in-tupac-shakurs-killi-p12352-131.htm	2025-02-25 00:00:00-05	LAS VEGAS — A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.\n\nThe trial of Duane “Keffe D” Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.\n\n“It looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,” Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.\n\nWhen asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.\nDavis’defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.\n\nAttorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.\n\nOn the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion “Suge” Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.\n\nDavis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur’s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.\n\nDavis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were “done for entertainment purposes and to make money.”\n\nArnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.\n\nProsecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.\n\nDefense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur’s death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:31.787165-04	2025-04-28 19:15:15.044619-04	https://suntci.com/25-02-2025-12-17-21-pm-5931868.png	Unknown Author	\N
110	TCI Vs Canada Boxing Match Tie In Historic Night For Turks And Caicos Islands Youth Boxing	2	https://suntci.com/tci-vs-canada-boxing-match-tie-in-historic-night-for-turks-and-caicos-islan-p12582-130.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	In a spectacular display of skill and determination on April 5, Team TCI and Team Canada each captured two official victories, kicking off what is expected to be the first of many annual international boxing exchanges.\n\nDespite the evening ending in a 2-2 tie between the teams, the night was filled with excitement, with seven matches filling up the event that showcased impressive displays of skill and a celebration of international sportsmanship that captivated the sold-out venue at the Gustavus Lightbourne Sports Complex.\n\nIn the individual bouts, TCI's Kenson Odena defeated Canada's Adam Lively in the second match of the night, securing best boxer for team TCI, followed by another victory for the home team when Frank Penn bested Akshay Takar.\n\nTeam Canada responded with Elijah Kulea winning his match against JJ Sanjusty before Noah Wyville secured the tie for the visitors by defeating Jayden Parker in the final bout and also securing best boxer for team Canada. The night featured exhibition matches and a demonstration fight that wasn't officially judged.\n\nIn an interview at the event, Minister of Education, Youth & Sports Rachel Taylor expressed her excitement and involvement in the event coming to life. "I'm elated. I'm excited about a dream that came to fruition," said Taylor. "It was only about two years ago when we decided that we would provide the opportunity for our students to harness their skill in the area of boxing."\n\nThe boxing program, which started roughly a year ago at the Philips Rolling Community Center, was initially guided by the late Jim Kelly and Gary Liburn before bringing on additional coaching staff. A touching moment during the event saw Kelly's son receive a special recognition for his father's contributions, with a traditional ten-count bell ceremony performed in Kelly's memory.\n\nMinister Taylor emphasized the importance of sports integration in young people's lives, particularly highlighting how boxing has helped many of the participants develop discipline and focus. "We are losing a lot of our young men to the streets," she noted. "This is an avenue to keep them focused, promote discipline and, most importantly, it provides them opportunity for critical thinking as well as building their leadership skills."\n\nKenson Odena, who represented Team TCI and was named best boxer for the home team, echoed these sentiments. "Humble, respect, and discipline," he said when asked what he had learned from boxing. "This sport really saved my life."\n\nThe event represented more than just competition—it symbolized international cooperation and the expansion of sports tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nKevin Wyville from Team Canada described the experience as "overwhelming," praising the hospitality they received. "It was just great crowds, everyone's supportive. The other team was just a great group of people. Everyone treated us good, and it was just a wonderful experience."\n\nMinister of Tourism, the Honorable Zhavargo Jolly, expressed his commitment to supporting sports tourism initiatives. "Tonight is a huge statement," he said during the event. "I want this to become an annual event on our calendar, and we want people traveling from around the world to come and enjoy Fight Night in Turks and Caicos every year."\n\nThe sold-out event drew attention from various government officials, including Governor Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam, who presented awards to the boxers. The strong turnout impressed Jarrett Forbes, Director of the Sports Commission.\n\n"We loved the support. The support was amazing; we did not know what to expect," Forbes said. "When we saw the entire community come out in numbers, we were sold out. It was a sold-out event, and I think that really inspired the fighters."\n\nPlans are already underway for TCI boxers to visit Canada for a return competition. Minister Taylor mentioned that her ministry is "in the process of developing [a boxing] federation so that they can receive additional grounds like all the other federations."\n\nThe international exchange also included three days of coaching workshops conducted by Team Canada for local coaches, helping to build capacity for the sport's development in the islands.\n\nForbes believes interest in boxing will increase following the event. "What you see here tonight was talent and hard work coming together. These guys train every day, at least four days a week at the community center. Once you expose kids to that level of training, they're bound to improve."\n\nThe night concluded with awards for outstanding boxers, with Noah Wyville receiving recognition as best boxer for Team Canada and Kenson Odena earning the title for Team TCI, acknowledging their exceptional performance and technique throughout the event.\n\nAs the Felix Morley Boxing Club continues to grow, organizers hope this inaugural international event will serve as a foundation for expanding boxing opportunities throughout the Turks and Caicos Islands, offering more youth the chance to develop discipline, focus, and leadership skills through the sport.\n\n"Keep supporting sports, keep supporting our young people in sport," urged Forbes. "Sport takes not just manpower, it takes money. So in any way that you can, you can come out and make a difference in the development of sports."	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:34.698709-04	2025-04-28 19:15:21.873393-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-08-42-08-am-6665792.png	Unknown Author	\N

Assistant Coach Mr. Ludane Dixon highlighted the importance of inclusivity and school spirit: “Sports Day encourages participation at all skill levels and fosters physical health, teamwork, and school pride.”\n\nFrom traditional races to novelty events such as the egg-and-spoon race and three-legged race, every student had the chance to participate. The new cheerleading segment added extra energy and excitement, strengthening the sense of unity within the school community.\n\nFounding Director Pastor Bradley Handfield was particularly impressed, stating, “I left with the impression that with faith and further training, several of our students have the potential to be professional athletes.”\n\nA special thank you goes to the school’s principal, PTA Presidents, officials, and staff for their dedication in making Sports Day a success. Gratitude is also extended to the Pastor for officiating the event.\n\nAs CCA looks ahead to the Inter-Primary Track and Field Championships, the school is proud of its young athletes and their achievements.

113	Stephen Curry Joins Alma Mater Davidson As Assistant GM For Basketball	2	https://suntci.com/stephen-curry-joins-alma-mater-davidson-as-assistant-gm-for-basketball-p12455-130.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry will serve as an assistant general manager for Davidson College’s basketball teams.\n\nThe four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP will be the first active player in U.S. major professional sports to take an administrative job with a college team. He will continue to play with the Warriors while serving in this newly created role.\n\nCurry and his wife, Ayesha, and longtime Davidson supporters Don, Matt and Erica Berman, are creating an eight-figure fund to support the college’s men’s and women’s basketball teams. The college asked them to serve in these advisory roles, investing their time and sharing their experience with both men’s and women’s basketball, according to a news release on Monday.\n\nCurry will draw resources and support from the Under Armour global sports marketing team, one of his major sponsors.\n\nHe said he wants Davidson’s scholar-athletes to be able to compete in the top ranks of college athletics in an ever-changing landscape where athletes are now allowed to profit from their name, image and likeness — something that wasn’t available when he played there for three seasons from 2006-09.\n\n“The Davidson experience is top notch,” said Curry said, a three-time Southern Conference first-team selection at Davidson. “My journey from when I got to Davidson in 2006 to now demonstrated that I had the opportunity to play basketball at the highest level, got a great education, an amazing network through the Davidson alumni and continue to wave the Davidson flag. I want very talented, high character student-athletes to have that same experience.”\n\nVice president and director of athletics Chris Clunie said basketball remains Davidson’s flagship sport, but the benefits of focusing on that game extend further.\n\n“When our basketball programs are successful,” Clunie said, “they provide much-needed revenue and exposure to support all our athletics programs and raise the overall visibility of the college.”\n\nDavidson is 16-15 this season in men’s basketball.\n\nCurry said the goal is to invest in the next student-athlete that’s coming into Davidson.\n“They don’t have to take cuts on what the market says they deserve to be part of the brand of what it means to be a Davidson scholar-athlete with integrity in your academic experience,” Curry said. “The commitment to a four-year graduation process provides countless opportunities professionally in sports or as a game changer in life.”\n\nMatt Berman will also serve as assistant GM alongside Curry.\n\n“Our ability to be a resource and a sounding board for the program, but also support each student athlete, to develop personal relationships with each of them to help guide them every step of the way through their Davidson experience,” Curry said.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr doesn’t expect Curry to miss games and start scouting players around the country.\n\n“I’m wondering is he going to clean house? Is he going in there and firing everybody? I don’t know, we’ll see, he’s got a big job on his hands,” Kerr cracked before the Warriors hosted Portland on Monday night. “I think he’s kind of busy so I’m hoping it’s a ceremonial role more than anything. If he asks me if he can leave and not play a game so he can go scout some college games, I’m probably going to say no, although it is Steph Curry so I’ll probably say yes actually. But I hope he does not ask.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:44.294899-04	2025-04-28 19:15:30.7608-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-56-32-pm-5927119.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
115	Tiger Woods Faces Another Injury And Another Lost Year. Has Golf Seen The Last Of Him?	2	https://suntci.com/tiger-woods-faces-another-injury-and-another-lost-year-has-golf-seen-the-l-p12453-130.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Golf without Tiger Woods was inevitable simply because of age.\n\nHe turns 50 at the end of this year and once leaned on the adage that “Father Time remains undefeated.” But for Woods, it has been the mother lode of injuries that is keeping him from going out on his own terms.\n\nThe latest was revealed in a social media post saying he had ruptured his left Achilles tendon and had surgery Tuesday — the minimally invasive variety, but one that keeps him out of the Masters next month and likely everything else the rest of the year.\n\n“It sucks,” Rory McIlroy said Wednesday at The Players Championship. “He doesn’t have much luck when it comes to injuries and his body. Hoping he’s in good spirits and hoping he’s OK. We obviously won’t see him play golf this year, and hopefully we see him maybe play in 2026.”\n\nEverything is “maybe” with Woods, the player who made golf cool to watch, who caused TV ratings to spike and prize money to soar, who delivered a level of dominance measured not only by his 15 majors and 82 titles on the PGA Tour but the fact that he had no lasting rival — until the injuries and surgeries began to accumulate.\n\nHis mother, Kultida, died last month and Woods withdrew from the Genesis Invitational as he coped with the loss. He chose not to be at The Players Championship, the final year of his exemption from winning the 2019 Masters.\n\n“As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,” he said in the post.\n\nAnother lost year for a player running out of time. The list of injuries is staggering.\n\nThe left knee. The lower back. Two stress fractures in his left tibia while winning the 2008 U.S. Open. An injury to his right Achilles tendon while running. An injury to his left Achilles tendon from hitting a shot off an awkward lie at the Masters.\n\nSix back surgeries, the most significant to fuse his lower back in 2017. A car crash on a coastal road outside Los Angeles that so badly damaged his right leg and ankle that he said doctors contemplated amputation. Plantar fasciitis. A strained oblique. Surgery to fuse his right ankle.\n\nHe kept coming back, and he remained a must-see attraction even though his appearance were largely limited to the majors. He has played eight majors since the 2021 car crash and only twice finished all 72 holes — both at the Masters. He was never in hunt at either one.\n\nThere was a time when Woods was on pace to break the gold standard in golf — 18 majors won by Jack Nicklaus — until that looked more unlikely with each injury.\n\n“If he’d have been healthy, I think he would have got it,” Nicklaus said in an interview two weeks ago with Golf Channel. “But he didn’t remain healthy. We all have injuries, we all have different things that change things. Tiger had his problems. I feel bad for him.”\n\nNicklaus recalled telling Woods: “Nobody wants their records to be broken. But I don’t want it not to be broken because you don’t have the ability to do so. I feel bad for him on that.”\n\nWoods won his last major at the 2019 Masters, an astonishing victory considering it was only two years earlier that he struggled to walk up the stairs to the Masters Club dinner. And then he won later in the year in Japan for his record-tying 82nd title on the PGA Tour.\nThat was his last win. He hasn’t come close since.\n\nWhat keeps him going? What is there left to prove? That’s a question all golfers face, whether it’s age or injury. Few other sports offer such longevity.\n\nMcIlroy turns 36 in May — this is his 18th year as a pro. He knows the day is coming, and he has mapped out an exit strategy.\n\n“Whenever I feel like the time is right, I’ll have no problem moving aside and letting the next generation do their thing,” McIlroy said. “I’d also like to walk away with a little bit left in the tank. I don’t want to be out there embarrassing myself. I’d like to walk away maybe a little before I should, put it that way.\n\n“I think if you can come to terms with that and walk away on your own terms, then that’s a good thing.”\n\nNicklaus never wanted to be a ceremonial golfer. He played in all the majors for 12 years after winning his last one at the 1986 Masters.\n\nHas golf seen the last of Woods? He is exempt for life at the Masters and PGA Championship. He can play the British Open for 10 more years. He can walk away on his own terms, but his health will have a big say in that.\n\nMcIlroy was asked if he could ever see Woods being competitive again. That’s what so many fans want to see — hope to see — in the absence of any evidence the last five years.\n\n“He’ll try — I know he’ll try,” McIlroy said. “But that’s a question for him, not for me.

117	Nikola Jokic Turns 30 And He’s Having One Of His Best Seasons, Averaging A Triple-Double	2	https://suntci.com/nikola-jokic-turns-and-hes-having-one-of-his-best-seasons-averaging-a-p12350-130.htm	2025-02-25 00:00:00-05	DENVER — The Denver Nuggets gathered around Nikola Jokic near the 3-point line Wednesday and belted out a rather off-key version of “ happy birthday ” in honor of him turning 30.\n\nUsually so poised on the court, the three-time NBA MVP seemed almost bashful.\n“I don’t like my birthday,” Jokic explained. “Getting older.”\n\nAnd better?\n\n“Like wine,” he cracked.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Jokic remains very much a kid at heart, right down to his new Peppa Pig-themed sneakers. But his game has certainly matured to the point where he keeps setting the bar higher and higher for himself and just might be in the midst of his finest season of them all. He’s averaging 29.8 points, 12.6 rebounds and 10.2 assists.\n\nIn addition, he’s posted a league-leading 25 triple-doubles, which is just four shy of tying the franchise record he set in 2022-23.\n\nHis coach, Michael Malone, was stumped by just what might be the ceiling for his big man?\n\n“Geez, I don’t know. He keeps on pushing the envelope,” said Malone, whose team will host Charlotte on Thursday night. “When you’re dealing with greatness, you never want to put a ceiling on that. We want to give him room to grow and and watch that, because it’s really fun to be a part of that process.”\n\nJokic began suiting up for the Nuggets as a 20-year-old kid who needed to improve his fitness and hone his footwork. Over the past decade, he’s blossomed into one of the league’s most hard-to-contain players and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in 2023.\n\nHe’s married now with two young kids. He has a bronze medal he earned with Serbia last summer at the Paris Olympics. His sponsor, 361 Degrees, is getting ready to launch his signature shoe, which is inspired by Peppa Pig, the character in the long-running children’s series. (“They made it. I like it. They’re going to be cool,” Jokic said.)\n\nThis season, he’s showing off the latest wrinkle to his game — long-range shooting. He’s hitting a career-best 45% from beyond the 3-point line.\n\n“He is playing the best basketball of his life,” Malone said. “At his heart, he’s still the same person. He’s still Nikola Jokic from Sombor, Serbia. He’s never forgotten where he’s come from, or who’s helped him get here.”\n\nGiven his style of play, Malone believes Jokic could last in the league at an elite level for a while.\n\n“The way (Jokic) dominates the game is with intelligence and skill, not athleticism,” Malone said. “He’s not driving down the lane and dunking on people every night. So I think that bodes well for his longevity.”\n\nThat is, if the desire remains strong. He said that sticking around long enough so his kids can see him play is, “not going to be a factor for me.”\n\nJokic returned to town after competing for Chuck’s Global Stars in the All-Star Game last weekend. He had two points in 10 minutes as his squad lost to Shaq’s OGs in the final.\nIt wasn’t exactly his idea of rest and relaxation.\n\n“Part of the business, part of the job,” Jokic said of his trip to San Francisco for the weekend festivities. “I would rather be somewhere else ... it’s a blessing and a curse.”\n\nNow, it’s back to work for the Nuggets, who have won eight in a row and are currently the third seed in the Western Conference. They’re returning to health, too, with Michael Porter Jr. (hamstring), Russell Westbrook (hamstring) and Aaron Gordon (calf) all going through practice Wednesday. The only player missing was Peyton Watson (knee).\n\nThey have 27 games remaining to tinker with lineups and find the right combinations for a playoff push.\n\n“People say, ‘Oh, that’s a tough decision,’” Malone said. “I look at it the opposite way. I’m really fortunate to have a tough decision to make where you have quality players that have really impacted winning. It’s never about one player. It’s about what’s best for our team.”\n\nThat’s the attitude of Jokic, too.\n\n“He’s our heartbeat,” said Julian Strawther, who took part in the Rising Stars event over the weekend. “It’s not always being a vocal leader but leading by example with the things he does and how hard he works. Having him on our side, it makes us feel a lot better.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:59.711657-04	2025-04-28 19:15:47.516343-04	https://suntci.com/25-02-2025-12-15-11-pm-2743211.png	Unknown Author	\N
114	Cavaliers Tie Their Team Record With 15th Straight Win	2	https://suntci.com/cavaliers-tie-their-team-record-with-th-straight-win-p12454-130.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	The wins and accomplishments keep piling up for the NBA-leading Cleveland Cavaliers. They’ve been so frequent that players are having a hard time keeping track.\n\n“What did we do? Oh, we clinched the Central Division,” center Jarrett Allen said, chuckling. “That’s something. We had fun tonight. We still celebrate the little things.”\n\nThere was nothing little about the Cavaliers’ 109-104 victory over Brooklyn on Tuesday.\n\nCleveland tied its franchise record for consecutive wins with 15 — after setting the mark in the first 15 games of the season — and is tied for the fifth-best start in NBA history at 55-10.\n\nEven with All-Star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell (left groin soreness), sixth man De’Andre Hunter (illness) and sharpshooter Ty Jerome (rest) in street clothes on the bench, the Cavaliers rallied from an 18-point deficit in the second half against the Nets.\nAll-Star point guard Darius Garland, who scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, said Mitchell’s message to him was concise during the comeback.\n\n“Shoot the ball,” he said. “Quote, end quote.”\n\nHaving spent his entire career with Cleveland, Garland sought out team president of basketball operations Koby Altman in the locker room. The Cavaliers’ last division crown occurred before he was drafted in 2019.\n\n“I asked Koby if there was going to be a banner in the practice facility,” Garland said. “We don’t take regular-season games lightly, but the reality is we haven’t won anything yet. The main thing, our main focus is trying to stay healthy.”\n\nInjuries to Mitchell and Allen during the 2024 playoffs were a crushing blow to Cleveland in its five-game loss to eventual champion Boston in the East semifinals.\n\nFirst-year coach Kenny Atkinson stressed that Mitchell’s current ailment is not serious and plans on continuing to give his key players nights off as the regular season winds down.\nAdvertisement\n\n“To win 15 straight games at this juncture, there is fatigue, so it’s really quite an accomplishment,” Atkinson said. “After doing it our first 15 games, it’s remarkable. We want bigger things, but we’ll look back on this and say it’s a pretty big accomplishment.”\nNext on the Cavaliers’ checklist is locking up the No. 1 seed in the East. They are eight games in front of the second-place Celtics with 17 remaining and hold a two-game advantage over West-leading Oklahoma City for the best record in the NBA.\n\nCleveland’s home-court advantage has been overwhelming at Rocket Arena, where it also has the top mark in the league at 30-4.\n\n“Their confidence and the swagger they’re playing with, you can see it in close games,” Brooklyn coach Jordi Fernandez said. “They’re very well coached and it’s fun to watch them play. It helps the business of the NBA.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:48.306839-04	2025-04-28 19:43:50.588418-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/HEde4VbmSlqmQWbAODtXmA.png?exp=1745970230&sig=fd0fb6d434f92a5cdc10c9585b7176beb50d5848d889c0405680613f36a287db	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/HEde4VbmSlqmQWbAODtXmA.png?exp=1745970230&sig=fd0fb6d434f92a5cdc10c9585b7176beb50d5848d889c0405680613f36a287db
119	Victor Wembanyama Expected To Miss Remainder Of Season After Blood Clot Diagnosis, Spurs Announce	2	https://suntci.com/victor-wembanyama-expected-to-miss-remainder-of-season-after-blood-clot-dia-p12349-130.htm	2025-02-25 00:00:00-05	San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama’s season is likely over after he was diagnosed with a blood clot in his right shoulder, a condition that will sideline one of the league’s brightest stars and is the second massive health-related hit for the Spurs in a matter of months.\n\nWembanyama is beginning treatment immediately and the Spurs are working under the expectation that the 7-foot-3 center from France will fully recover, said a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because those details were not released publicly.\n\nIt may even be possible for Wembanyama — the NBA’s leading shot-blocker this season and a first-time All-Star — to play this summer for France in the European championships if he chooses, the person said.\n\n“You can’t replace Vic,” Spurs guard Chris Paul said. “I can’t stand on a guy’s shoulders and block every shot that comes to the rim. Aside from his basketball ability, his charisma and what he brings into the locker room, I think, is what we’ll miss the most.”\n\nWembanyama’s condition — deep vein thrombosis — was diagnosed this week after he returned from the All-Star Game, the Spurs said Thursday. It is almost always treated with blood-thinning medication, and players in contact sports such as basketball have long been advised to avoid playing while using such medication because of the heightened chance of bleeding.\n\nWembanyama’s diagnosis comes about 3 1/2 months after Spurs coach Gregg Popovich had a stroke and was forced to take a leave from the sideline, with assistant coach Mitch Johnson serving as acting coach ever since. The Spurs have said Popovich’s condition is improving, but there is no timetable for his return to the bench.\n\n“Man, it’s been extremely tough, to say the least,” Paul said. “This organization, how they put everything into perspective. Obviously, the Pop situation, knowing what he means to the league and Vic, him playing his first All-Star Game ... for us, we know we’ve got a job to do but just like anybody we worry about our people.”\n\nWembanyama was the league’s rookie of the year last season and the frontrunner to be defensive player of the year this season. He has already taken 403 3-pointers and blocked 176 shots this season — no player in NBA history has ever finished a season with those numbers, and Wembanyama did it this year by the All-Star break.\n\nHe is averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, 3.8 blocks and 3.7 assists; the only other player to finish a season averaging all that was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975-76. The Spurs open their post-All-Star schedule later Thursday in Austin, Texas, against the Phoenix Suns. Wembanyama had been listed as doubtful for that game because of illness.\n\nMiami Heat forward Kevin Love, who learned of Wembanyama’s situation as he walked off the practice floor Thursday, said he was in “absolute shock.”\n\n“First of all, you pray for him. You hope for the best, personally and professionally,” Love said. “He means so much to the league. He’s an incredible competitor and he has a runway to be the face of the league for the next 20 years. I can’t imagine this league without him in the short term or in the long term. He’s that important.”\n\nSuch cases have affected NBA players before, including now-retired Hall of Famer Chris Bosh — whose career was cut short after he was diagnosed with blood clots while playing with Miami. Brandon Ingram, now with the Toronto Raptors, had his 2018-19 season end early because of deep vein thrombosis when he was with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Detroit’s Ausar Thompson had a clot issue that saw him miss the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe question for the Spurs’ medical team to answer now surrounds why this happened to Wembanyama.\n\n“Any time we have upper extremity or arm blood clots, we always need to ask ourselves why they happened,” said Dr. Geoffrey Barnes, an associate professor of cardiology and vascular medicine at the University of Michigan. “And so, looking for the cause is going to be a really important piece of this. ... It’s really important to understand why this happened, because then that’ll dictate what the treatments are and what the long term consequences may be.”\n\nSome athletes have come back, sometimes better than ever, after dealing with blood clots.\n\nSerena Williams was diagnosed with the problem known as a pulmonary embolism — a clot on the lung — in 2011, and was the dominant women’s tennis player in the world again when she returned.\n\n“Scariest thing I ever experienced,” Williams said months after returning.\n\nWembanyama — the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft — is widely considered the brightest young star in the game, someone who led France to the silver medal at last year’s Paris Olympics.\n\nPaul said he’s talked with Wembanyama since the diagnosis, but did not share details.\n“It’s tough,” Paul said. “It’s tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team and but moreso knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play.”	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:06.407378-04	2025-04-28 19:15:56.992776-04	https://suntci.com/25-02-2025-12-13-37-pm-5860940.png	Unknown Author	\N

122	U.S. Foreign Aid Cuts Might Devastate Global Progress Against HIV/AIDS	2	https://suntci.com/us-foreign-aid-cuts-might-devastate-global-progress-against-hivaids-p12557-126.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	HIV could explode worldwide in the wake of U.S. cuts to foreign aid, resulting in millions of AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infection, a new analysis says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has floated the notion of ending the President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, a program created under President George W. Bush that combats HIV and AIDS in the developing world.\n\nThe Trump Administration paused all foreign aid funding Jan. 20, ostensibly for a 90-day review and evaluation, with only limited exception. Authorization for PEPFAR lapsed Tuesday, according to CBS News, and the world is now watching and waiting to see what will come next.\n\nSuch funding cuts could undo decades of progress made to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat, researchers argue in a study published Wednesday in The Lancet HIV.\nThat study came at the same time Britain's Prince Harry withdrew from an AIDS/HIV charity he led in Africa for 19 years.\n\nIf U.S. aid is cut, researchers estimate that new HIV infections could surge to as many as 10.8 million additional cases, and HIV-related deaths to 2.9 million, by 2030.\n\n"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing," co-lead researcher Debra ten Brink, a senior research officer at Australia's Burnet Institute, said in a news release.\n\n"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unraveled," ten Brink said. "It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally."\n\nFive nations provide more than 90% of total international HIV funding, and the U.S. pays nearly three-quarters of that, researchers said in background notes.\n\nTo estimate the potential effects of cuts to HIV funding, researchers projected infection and death rates in 26 countries that currently receive funds to hold the line against the virus.\n\nAs much as a six-fold increase in new infections could occur, with between 4.4 million and 10.8 million additional new HIV infections by 2030.\n\nThe cuts could also result in between 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths by 2030, results show.\n\n"There could be an even greater impact in sub-Saharan Africa, where broader prevention efforts, such as distributing condoms and offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP is a medication that reduces the risk of getting HIV.) are at first risk to be discontinued," co-lead researcher Rowan Martin-Hughes, a senior research officer with the Burnet Institute, said in a news release.\n\n"This is in addition to disruptions in testing and treatment programs [that] could cause a surge in new HIV infections, especially in some of the areas where the greatest gains have been made, such as preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV and pediatric HIV deaths," Martin-Hughes added.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2023, countries that receive foreign aid made significant progress against HIV, with an average 8% annual decrease in new infections and a 10% decrease in HIV-related deaths, researchers noted.\n\nResearchers said if foreign aid is greatly reduced, new infections and deaths could be expected to rise back to levels not seen since 2010, potentially undoing all progress made since 2000.\n\nEven a temporary cut in funding of one to two years could represent a setback that would require an additional 20 to 30 years of investment before HIV/AIDS is ended as a public health threat, researchers wrote.\n\nThe U.S. action dovetailed with news that a management dispute prompted Prince Harry to step down as a patron of Sentebale, a charity he set up to help young people with HIV and AIDS in the African nations of Lesotho and Botswana.\n\nReuters noted that he co-founded the charity in 2006 in memory of his mother Princess Diana, who helped combat stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:16.326558-04	2025-04-28 19:44:01.772664-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ubXSglo0Sa2ZzgIlObWrSw.png?exp=1745970241&sig=c0e13d09fe369def086868783e03fcafdef4fbc12e1ece06ad35237b2494c1e4	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ubXSglo0Sa2ZzgIlObWrSw.png?exp=1745970241&sig=c0e13d09fe369def086868783e03fcafdef4fbc12e1ece06ad35237b2494c1e4
123	Why No One Is Challenging Trump’s Executive Order That Keeps TikTok Running	2	https://suntci.com/why-no-one-is-challenging-trumps-executive-order-that-keeps-tiktok-running-p12556-126.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	WASHINGTON — After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.\n\nThe Republican president’s executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.\n\nFew of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.\n\nDespite a bipartisan consensus about the risk to national security posed by TikTok’s ties to China, “it’s as if nothing ever happened,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute.\n\nTikTok has stayed online, delighting 170 million users in the U.S.\n\nTikTok continues to function, much to the delight of its 170 million users in the U.S., and the tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle have been persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump’s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.\n\nTrump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.\n\nTrump’s action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump’s inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.\n\nThe court’s opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users’ data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.\n\n“The record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. “According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access ‘any data’ stored in a consenting user’s ‘contact list’ — including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.”\n\nTikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China’s Foreign Ministry has said China’s government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence” held in foreign countries.\n\nTrump was against TikTok before he was for it\n\nThe day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.\n\nThe president’s position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.\n\nTrump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would “save TikTok,” then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.\n\nThe law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there’s a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.\n\nTrump’s actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. “The law does not permit the sort of ‘extension’ that Donald Trump has announced,” Rozenshtein said.\n\nBut both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.\n“Who’s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they’re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,” Kreps said.\n\nIt also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.\n\nMore importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early “example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.”\n\nWhile Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.\n\nCompanies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok’s operations since the law’s effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.\n\nTech companies initially lacked clear guidance\n\nThe companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump’s order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but “Apple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.”\n\nThe companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.\n\nThe Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.\n\nAmong the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBut rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. “If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal — plain and simple,” Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nSeveral potential bidders have stepped forward.\n\nPerplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity’s business with TikTok’s U.S. operations.\n\nAnother possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok’s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.\n\nJesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:19.521793-04	2025-04-28 19:16:15.047839-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-11-33-02-am-2319645.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival Southwest Airlines.\n\nEarlier this week, Southwest shocked customers by announcing it will start charging for checked bags for the first time in its half-century of flying, a huge strategy move for the largest domestic U.S. carrier. (There are some exceptions to Southwest’s new bag rules, which take effect in late May.)\n\n“I think it’s going to be painful for a little bit as they find their footing, and we’re going to take advantage of that,” Spirit’s Christie said in an interview Thursday.\n\nSouthwest had been a standout in the U.S. by offering all customers two free checked bags, a perk that has endured recessions, spikes in fuel prices and other crises while most rivals introduced bag fees and raised them every few years.\n\nSpirit Airlines, on the other hand, made a la carte pricing common in the U.S., with fees for seat assignments, checked bags and other add-ons. It’s a strategy most large airlines, except for Southwest, have copied in one form or another.\n\nAs Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn’t include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said.\n\nSouthwest said it would get rid of its single-class open seating model last year.\n“There at least was an audience of people who were intentionally selecting and flying Southwest because they felt that it was easy. They knew they were going to get two bags,” Christie said. “Now that that’s no longer the case, it’s easy to say that they’re going to widen their aperture and they’re now going to look around.”\n\nSpirit is far smaller than Southwest and even smaller than it was last year, but it competes with the airline in cities like Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. If customers look on travel sites like Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit’s tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said.\nOther airline executives have also said they expect to win over some Southwest customers.\n\nDelta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday that there are consumers who choose Southwest based on its free bag perk “and now those customers are up for grabs.”\n\nSpirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.\n\nThe carrier is now focused on returning to profitability. It posted a net loss of over $1.2 billion last year, more than double its loss in 2023 as it grappled with grounded jets because of a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, higher costs, more domestic competition and a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways.\n\nSpirit has rejected multiple recent merger attempts by fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines. Christie said Thursday that nothing is “off the table” and that a fifth-largest airline in the U.S. as a low-cost carrier makes sense, but that the airline is focused on stabilizing itself after bankruptcy.\n\nThrough its restructuring process, which started in November, Spirit said it reduced its debt by about $795 million. The transaction converted debt into equity for major creditors. The carrier also received a $350 million equity infusion.\n\nSpirit plans to relist its shares on a stock exchange but hasn’t set a date yet.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:23.362052-04	2025-04-28 19:16:18.776096-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-44-11-pm-8260384.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
125	This ‘Dune’ Isn’t Fiction. It’s The Longest Conveyer Belt In The US And Moving Sand In Texas	2	https://suntci.com/this-dune-isnt-fiction-its-the-longest-conveyer-belt-in-the-us-and-mov-p12451-126.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	KERMIT, Texas — It’s longer than the width of Rhode Island, snakes across the oil fields of the southwest U.S. and crawls at 10 mph – too slow for a truck and too long for a train.\nIt’s a new sight: the longest conveyer belt in America.\n\nAtlas Energy Solutions, a Texas-based oil field company, has installed a 42-mile long (67 kilometers) conveyer belt to transport millions of tons of sand for hydraulic fracturing. The belt the company named “The Dune Express” runs from tiny Kermit, Texas, and across state borders into Lea County, New Mexico. Tall and lanky with lids that resemble solar modules, the steel structure could almost be mistaken for a roller coaster.\n\nIn remote West Texas, there are few people to marvel at the unusual machine in Kermit, a city with a population of less than 6,000, where the sand is typically hauled by tractor-trailers. During fracking, liquid is pumped into the ground at a high pressure to create holes, or fractures, that release oil. The sand helps keep the holes open as water, oil and gas flow through it.\n\nBut moving the sand by truck is usually a long and potentially dangerous process, according to CEO John Turner. He said massive trucks moving sand and other industrial goods are a common site in the oil-rich Permian Basin and pose a danger to other drivers.\n“Pretty early on, the delivery of sand via truck was not only inefficient, it was dangerous,” he said.\n\nThe conveyor belt, with a freight capacity of 13 tons (11.79 metric tonnes), was designed to bypass and trudge alongside traffic.\n\nInnovation isn’t new to the oil and gas industry, nor is the idea to use a conveyor belt to move materials around. Another conveyer belt believed to be the world’s longest conveyor — at 61 miles (98.17 kilometers) long — carries phosphorous from a mine in Western Sahara on the northwest coast of Africa, according to NASA Earth Observatory.\n\nWhen moving sand by truck became a nuisance, an unprecedented and risky investment opportunity arose: constructing a $400 million machine to streamline the production of hydraulic fracturing. The company went public in March 2023, in part, to help pay for the conveyor belt and completed its first delivery in January, Turner said.\n\nThe sand sits in a tray-shaped pan with a lid that can be taken off at any point, but most of the it gets offloaded into silos near the Texas and New Mexico border. Along its miles-long journey, the sand is sold and sent to fracking companies who move it by truck for the remainder of the trip.\n\nKeeping the rollers on the belt aligned and making sure it runs smoothly are the biggest maintenance obstacles, according to Turner. The rollers are equipped with chips that signal when its about to fail and need to be replaced. This helps prevent wear and tear and keep the machine running consistently, Turner said.\n\nThe belt cuts through a large oil patch where environmentalists have long raised concerns about the industry disturbing local habitats, including those of the sagebrush lizard, which was listed as an endangered species last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n“In addition to that, we know that the sand will expedite further drilling nearby,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “We could see more drilling than we otherwise would, which means more air pollution, more spills than we otherwise would.”\nThe Dune Express currently runs for about 12 to 14 hours a day at roughly half capacity but the company expects to it to be rolling along at all hours later this year.\n\nIn New Mexico, Lea County Commissioner Brad Weber said he hopes the belt alleviates traffic on a parallel highway where car crashes are frequent.\n\n“I believe it’s going to make a very positive impact here,” he said.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:26.393838-04	2025-04-28 19:16:23.67642-04	https://suntci.com/18-03-2025-12-42-36-pm-1646473.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
128	Apple Unveils New MacBook Air Models With $100 Price Cut Despite Tariffs	2	https://suntci.com/apple-unveils-new-macbook-air-models-with-price-cut-despite-tariffs-p12413-126.htm	2025-03-12 00:00:00-04	Apple on Wednesday announced new MacBook Air models that update the company’s bestselling laptop with a faster M4 chip and an upgraded videoconferencing camera.\n\nThe computers also got a $100 price cut in the U.S., despite tariffs by President Donald Trump that took effect on Tuesday that experts have said could cause the price of electronics to rise.\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air starts at $999, and the larger, 15-inch model starts at $1,099. Users can pay more for memory and storage upgrades.\n\nAlthough it has the same design as last year’s MacBook Air, the new computer will also be available in a fresh sky bluecolor, and it now supports three external monitors. The new MacBook Air goes on sale March 12.\n\nThe MacBook Air is one of Apple’s most critical products. Mac sales rose 15% in the December quarter to just under $9 billion in sales. The company attributed that increase to higher sales of laptops even though overall Mac sales, which also include desktop models, are still down from the company’s fiscal 2022. That was a period when computer sales were elevated as a result of people needing laptops for work or school during the pandemic.\n\nApple’s MacBook Air announcement caps off a flurry of new product releases by the company over the past few weeks.\n\nIn addition to the new laptops, Apple on Wednesday announced a high-end Mac Studio desktop with a chip that can run advanced AI. The company also upgraded its iPad Air with an M4 chip on Tuesday, and last month, it announced the low-cost iPhone 16e.\n\nThe Mac Studio has more processing power and is designed for people who work on computer graphics, audio or video production or artificial intelligence. It’s not cheap — the computer starts at $1,999, and more powerful configurations can cost over $14,000.\nThe MacBook Air price cut comes as Apple’s U.S. pricing is being closely watched by both Apple customers and investors to see what the iPhone maker does in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\nApple’s announcement signals that the company isn’t jacking up prices yet.\n\nThe new iPad Airs announced this week didn’t see any price change and still start at $599. However, the iPhone 16e costs $599, and it replaced the older low-cost model from 2022 that started at $429.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America Securities last month forecast that PC makers including Apple would likely try to pass increased costs onto buyers. Rival Acer already announced price increases on laptops last month due to U.S. tariffs.\n\n“Tariffs on imported PCs act like a tax that PC vendors largely pass to end customers,” the BofA analysts wrote.\n\nThe majority of Apple’s products are made in China and could be affected by two sets of 10% tariffs Trump placed on Chinese imports. Apple’s operations and third-largest market could be affected by Chinese retaliation.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump at the White House last month. After the meeting, Trump said that Apple “doesn’t want to be in the tariffs.” Cook told investors in January that Apple is “monitoring the situation.”\n\nApple has expanded its supply chain in recent years. Some Macs are now assembled in Malaysia or Vietnam, production locations which would avoid Chinese import duties. Apple didn’t say where the new MacBook Airs are assembled.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:36.766936-04	2025-04-28 19:16:37.015738-04	https://suntci.com/12-03-2025-03-12-07-pm-1972768.png	Unknown Author	\N
121	Trump Says He Will Impose 10% Tariff On All Imports, With Higher Rates For Some	2	https://suntci.com/trump-says-he-will-impose-tariff-on-all-imports-with-higher-rates-for-p12558-126.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would impose a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher duties on some of the country's biggest trading partners, in a move that ratchets up a trade war that he kicked off on his return to the White House.\n\nThe sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine.\n\n"It's our declaration of independence," Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nTrump displayed a poster that listed reciprocal tariffs, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union, as a response to duties put on U.S. goods.\n\nOther details were not immediately apparent as Trump continued to make remarks that echoed his longstanding complaints that U.S. workers and companies are hurt by global trade.\n\nThe uncertainty has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since 1947.\n\nThe administration has said the new tariffs will take effect immediately after Trump announces them, though it has not yet published the official notice required for enforcement.\n\nThe administration, however, did publish an official notice that a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on April 3.\n\nTrump has already imposed 20% duties on all imports from China and 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products.\nHis advisers say the tariffs will return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States.\n\nOutside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. Businesses have complained that Trump's barrage of threats has made it difficult to plan their operations.\n\nTariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise.\n\nFinancial markets were volatile as investors awaited Trump's announcement. U.S. stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since February.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:12.989356-04	2025-04-28 19:43:56.218425-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ZxHhlkyeS36q48vNo54fCg.png?exp=1745970236&sig=d37625eff365e3fdd25d78b48924feda834f1c743c22d42f5c7eb168b2bf78d9	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ZxHhlkyeS36q48vNo54fCg.png?exp=1745970236&sig=d37625eff365e3fdd25d78b48924feda834f1c743c22d42f5c7eb168b2bf78d9
126	Egg Prices Are Rapidly Falling So Far In March	2	https://suntci.com/egg-prices-are-rapidly-falling-so-far-in-march-p12450-126.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	Egg prices have fallen sharply so far in March on some progress in ending a shortage, giving consumers some much-needed relief with the supermarket staple.\n\nThe cost of white large shell eggs declined to $6.85 per dozen, on average, last week, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That represents a decline of $1.20 per dozen, and a 15% pull back the USDA’s prior update on Feb. 28.\n\n“Demand for shell eggs continues to fade into the new month as no significant outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] have been detected in nearly two weeks,” the USDA wrote in its March 7 weekly update. “This respite has provided an opportunity for production to make progress in reducing recent shell egg shortages.”\n\nEgg prices have become a key pressure point for consumers that are tired of sticky inflation and worried about more potential price increases due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on a wide array of imports. While it is still unknown the full ramifications of the duties on Canada, China and Mexico, stocks have so far pulled back in 2025 on concern the moves could further raise prices of goods and tip a sagging economy into a recession.\n\nTo be sure, the price of eggs have still skyrocketed more than 170% from a year ago, USDA data shows. The rise has spurred an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into allegations of anticompetitive practices from some of the largest egg producers in the country. Firms including Cal-Maine Foods have touted a crushing avian flu outbreak, which has forced the culling of millions of egg-laying hens, as the major catalyst for the rise in egg prices.\n\n“The primary reason for the drop is actions taken by the administration’s Department of Justice to investigate the companies for possible antitrust violations,” said Joe Maxwell, president of Farm Action Fund, told CNBC. “The dominant firms have so much control over the market that they can increase prices and lower prices almost at will.”\n\n“There has been a softening of demand for eggs by consumers, but we do not see this as a significant factor, considering this has been an ongoing trend,” Maxwell added.\n\nEgg prices were a key factor in the February consumer price index report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics noting prices advanced 10.4% last month and 58.8% year-over-year. The marked-up price tag for eggs has even pushed consumers to begin shifting their breakfast habits.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:30.299711-04	2025-04-28 19:44:07.535073-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/qXmuY5IuTyaTsUiE4W-Bww.png?exp=1745970247&sig=64af30e145f91601d6d6fb288e8ef4898d5f46d44c8aac88f6b85cf5cab795ca	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/qXmuY5IuTyaTsUiE4W-Bww.png?exp=1745970247&sig=64af30e145f91601d6d6fb288e8ef4898d5f46d44c8aac88f6b85cf5cab795ca
127	Canada And The EU Swiftly Retaliate Against Trump’s Steel And Aluminum Tariffs	2	https://suntci.com/canada-and-the-eu-swiftly-retaliate-against-trumps-steel-and-aluminum-tari-p12449-126.htm	2025-03-18 00:00:00-04	BRUSSELS — Major trade partners swiftly hit back at President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, imposing stiff new taxes on U.S products from textiles and water heaters to beef and bourbon.\n\nCanada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said Wednesday it will place 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products and also raise taxes on a host of items: tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sports equipment, and cast-iron products.\nAcross the Atlantic, the European Union will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans.\n\nCombined, the new tariffs will cost companies billions of dollars, and further escalate the uncertainty in two of the world’s major trade partnerships. Companies will either take the losses and earn fewer profits, or, more likely, pass costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nPrices will go up, in Europe and the United States, and jobs are at stake, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said.\n\nThe EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs — taxes on imports — are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. The tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which are also on the list.\n\nSpirits producers have become collateral damage in the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move “is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,” said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended.\n\nCould there be an agreement that takes increasing tariffs off the table?\n\nVon der Leyen said in a statement that the EU “will always remain open to negotiation.”\nCanada’s incoming Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″\n\nCarney, who will be sworn in Friday, said workers in both countries will be better off when “the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.”\n\n“We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” she said.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.” “The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.\n\nWhat will actually happen?\n\nTrump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.\n\nThis time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič traveled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.\n\nHe said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip “that the EU is not the problem.”\n\n“I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Šefčovič told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.\n\nCanada is imposing, as of 12:01 a.m. Thursday 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products worth $12.6 billion Canadian (US$8.7 billion) and aluminum products worth $3 billion Canadian (US$2 billion) as well as additional imported U.S. goods worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion) for a total of $29.8 billion (US$20.6 billion.)\n\nThe list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes tools, computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters, sport equipment, and cast-iron products.\nThese tariffs are in addition to Canada’s 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump tariffs that he’s delayed by a month.\n\nEuropean steel companies brace for losses\n\nThe EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports.\n\nThe EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:33.506572-04	2025-04-28 19:44:13.138042-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/2one_rT1Q2OMRyW9YlyiYg.png?exp=1745970253&sig=fd65d6e63ce946919f87a2216408f335ff5f398860744050c0b9f175a4781f92	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/2one_rT1Q2OMRyW9YlyiYg.png?exp=1745970253&sig=fd65d6e63ce946919f87a2216408f335ff5f398860744050c0b9f175a4781f92

The virtual launch, held on March 27, 2025, marked a major step toward advancing women’s economic empowerment and boosting their participation in international trade.\n\nThe SheTrades Caribbean Grow and Go Grant Facility targets women-owned and led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in CDB’s 19 Borrowing Member Countries (BMCs). It provides essential financial support for scaling businesses, expanding into new markets, and strengthening economic resilience. Additionally, the programme offers technical and capacity-building support through the SheTrades Caribbean Hub, a partnership with the International Trade Centre (ITC).\n\nEligible businesses can apply for grants of up to USD 25,000, available for enterprises in all exporting sectors, including agriculture, creative industries, manufacturing, technology, tourism, and hospitality services. Funding is provided through two streams: GROW - for firms enhancing internal capacity and systems and GO - for businesses ready to export or expand internationally.\n\nCDB’s Acting Director of Projects, Mr. L. O’Reilly Lewis, highlighted the importance of investing in women-led firms, particularly in the era of digital transformation: “In an era where global competition is intensifying and markets are rapidly evolving, empowering women in business is not just the right thing to do, it is a strategic imperative. By investing in their success, we are fortifying our region's position on the global stage, ensuring that women-led businesses not only thrive but lead in this new, interconnected world.”\n\nDr. Judith Fessehaie, Head of the Women and Trade Programme, SheTrades Initiative at the ITC, emphasised the significance of the fund in removing financial barriers which Caribbean Women MSMEs face: “By breaking financial barriers, this initiative ensures that more women can participate in and benefit from international trade.”\n\nCDB’s Acting Head of the Private Sector Division, Ms. Lisa Harding, underscored the urgency of closing the gender gap in international trade, noting that women lead only 15% of such businesses.\n\n“What’s even more concerning is that at the current pace of progress, it could take more than a century to bridge this gender gap. But I believe we are at a turning point, today, we have the opportunity to not only speed up the process but to build a future where women are at the forefront of international business and trade. Let’s discuss how we can make that future a reality, right now, in our region and beyond,” Ms. Harding said.\n\nThe launch saw participation from over 240 members of the SheTrades Caribbean Hub, alongside representatives from Gender Affairs Anguilla, Invest Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce, Export Barbados, BELTRAIDE, the Inter-American Development Bank, Compete Caribbean, and PowerHerful Women Centre of the JMMB Group Limited.\n\nSince its establishment in 2023, the SheTrades Caribbean Hub has emerged as a pioneering vehicle for women’s economic empowerment.

132	Cuba's Top Cigarmaker Breaks Record With Sales Of $827 Million In 2024	2	https://suntci.com/cubas-top-cigarmaker-breaks-record-with-sales-of-million-in-p12553-135.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	HAVANA - Cuba's top cigar maker Habanos said that sales of the company's luxurious smokes had soared to a record $827 million in 2024 as revenue poured in from fast-growing markets in China and elsewhere in Asia.\n\nHabanos Vice President Jorge Perez said revenue jumped 16% over the previous year as the company reaped high-end demand from a growing class of wealthy smokers in Asia, a region which now accounts for nearly one-quarter of the company's sales globally.\n\nCuba's cigar business, together with rum exports, is among the crisis-racked country's last thriving export industries and critically important for raising foreign currency necessary to buy food, fuel and medicine.\n\nHabanos S.A. is owned 50% by Cuba's communist-run government and 50% by a consortium of Asian investors under the umbrella group Tabacalera.\n\nSoaring sales in 2024 came even as Cuban growers struggle to recover from Hurricane Rafael in November and Hurricane Ian in 2022, both of which ravaged the western tobacco growing provinces of Artemisa and Pinar del Rio, damaging infrastructure and crops.\n\nJose Maria Lopez, a Habanos vice president for development, told Reuters at the company's annual festival outside Havana that tobacco production was "guaranteed" for its cigar-making despite recent natural disasters.\n\n"The total tobacco production in Cuba may be reduced but those are poorer quality tobaccos that would never enter the production of our export cigars," Lopez said.\n"Only a small part of all national tobacco production is dedicated to cigars, and that amount, from the highest quality leaves, is guaranteed," he added.\n\nCuba's luxuriously smooth tobacco has long topped the cigar industry, with aficionados touting the Caribbean island's unique variety of tobacco, rich soils, and ideal climate - as well as Habanos' insistence on rolling its cigars by hand.\n\nExecutives told reporters that China once again topped sales in terms of value, followed by Spain, Switzerland, Britain and Germany.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:52.396652-04	2025-04-28 19:16:50.82187-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-11-25-49-am-2702785.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
133	Dominican Hospitals Face Surge Of Haitian Mothers Fleeing Conflict	2	https://suntci.com/dominican-hospitals-face-surge-of-haitian-mothers-fleeing-conflict-p12552-135.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	As spiraling violence in Haiti puts healthcare out of reach for most, Haitian mothers are seeking care at hospitals in neighboring Dominican Republic despite government policies there scaling up deportations.\n\nThe two countries share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, but are divided by a heavily secured border, long-standing tensions and an immense wealth gap. Children born to Haitian parents in the Dominican Republic do not receive citizenship.\n\n"I had my child here," Cineas Lionne told Reuters from a hospital in the eastern city of Punta Cana. "I don't think I would receive good care in Haiti because of the situation with the government - there is no government."\n\nThe U.N. found in October that less than a quarter of hospitals were operating around Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, while those elsewhere struggle to cope with flows of refugees fleeing gang attacks.\n\nThat assessment came before a spike in violence in late 2024, that saw gangs shoot and kill journalists gathered at Haiti's largest public hospital for a government press conference meant to announce a long-awaited reopening. Those plans have been put on hold.\n\nThe violence has forced the capital's airport and ports to repeatedly shut down, prompting hospitals to warn of a lack of supplies such as blood and oxygen. Aid group Doctors Without Borders temporarily halted services last year due to threats.\n\n"The doctors here have treated me well," said Beatrice Agustin, who gave birth in a maternity hospital in the Dominican capital.\n\n"In Haiti there are many gangsters. You can't give birth there, but also if you are here without papers," giving birth in the Dominican Republic is complicated, she said.\n\nU.N. experts have warned in recent years that pregnant and postpartum Haitian women seeking medical care in the Dominican Republic have faced intimidation, detention and deportation, citing raids on public hospitals and arrests during check-ups.\n\nThe U.N. experts have called on neighboring nations to stop deporting Haitians back home, where over 5 million people are going hungry and over 1 million are internally displaced as armed gangs continue to gain territory. Many families are sharing homes or living in makeshift camps.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has pledged to deport up to 10,000 people a week as it deals with the brunt of the migration of Haitians fleeing conflict at home. It deported over 200,000 Haitians last year and nearly 15,000 in first two weeks of 2025.\n\nDominican politicians have accused Haitian migrants of fueling insecurity and said their country is already giving too much.\n\n"Our infrastructure does not have the capacity to receive that number of people," Senator and former health minister Daniel Rivera told Reuters, saying the priority was expanding healthcare for Dominicans.\n\nLocal doctors said many Haitian women are afraid to attend prenatal checkups and tend to arrive late at night or when they are about to give birth, due to the risk of deportation.\nNational health service director Martin Ortiz noted that migration officials are not permitted to enter to make arrests inside hospitals.\n\n"Our mission is to provide care," he said. "The same care is given equally."	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:56.768689-04	2025-04-28 19:16:55.586108-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-11-24-11-am-1989819.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

Chief U.S. District Judge F. Dennis Saylor scheduled sentencing for June 20. Viliena's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth the criminal and civil case shed a light on the widespread violence that has plagued Haiti.\n\nProsecutors said that in applying for a visa in 2008, Viliena had affirmed on a form that he had not "ordered, carried out or materially assisted in extrajudicial and political killings and other acts of violence against the Haitian people."\n\nIn fact, Viliena, after being elected to a four-year term as mayor of Les Irois in December 2006, personally committed or ordered the maiming, harm, humiliation or death of his adversaries, prosecutors alleged.\n\nThey said the victims include the three Haitians who pursued the earlier lawsuit, David Boniface, Juders Yseme and Nissage Martyr.\n\nThat case was filed in 2017 under the Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows for U.S. lawsuits against foreign officials accused of extrajudicial killings or torture when avenues for redress in their home countries are exhausted.\n\nProsecutors said Viliena in 2007 led a group of armed men to Boniface's home who then beat and fatally shot his brother, and later mobilized a group in 2008 that beat and shot Martyr and Yseme at a community radio station.	\N	2025-04-27 18:18:06.735774-04	2025-04-28 19:44:31.079294-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/G9dT_WeiTsGLGrEBmg-z6g.png?exp=1745970271&sig=8aa38075b2b5e80f79a1ad9c1af0a592a3c42be459244a4a777e329d6fe658a0	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/G9dT_WeiTsGLGrEBmg-z6g.png?exp=1745970271&sig=8aa38075b2b5e80f79a1ad9c1af0a592a3c42be459244a4a777e329d6fe658a0

During the search, officers found two high-powered, military-style firearms and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. Following this discovery, thorough investigations were conducted as officers pursued various leads.\n\n\n\n\n One suspected gang member is currently in police custody in connection with the discovery. Commissioner of Police Fitz Bailey said: “The seizure of these dangerous weapons sends a clear and unequivocal message—we will not tolerate violence and lawlessness in our communities. This significant find has potentially prevented the loss of life and further acts of violence against law-abiding citizens.\n\n\n\n\n“Our officers remain resolute in their mission to pursue individuals who possess and traffic illegal firearms. Seven firearms have been seized from January 1 to April 23rd, 2025. Five of which were pistols. The recovered weapons have been sent for ballistic testing.\n\n\n\n\n “This operation forms part of the RT&CIPF’s intensified anti-crime suppression activities aimed at removing illegal firearms from the streets, disrupting criminal networks, and enhancing public safety. “Our anti-crime efforts remain focused on high-visibility and intelligence-driven operations. The successes recorded over the past week are a testament to our officers' dedication and hard work towards achieving our crime reduction targets for 2025 and making the islands safer.”\n\n\n\n\nThe RT&CIPF will continue to conduct targeted operations, including road traffic stops and search exercises, in areas harbouring priority offenders and suspects.\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the public are reminded of their vital role in supporting law enforcement efforts.

Edwin Astwood\n\nAs the leader of the opposition and a proud resident of Grand Turk, I am deeply concerned and disheartened by Carnival Cruise Line’s recent announcement to divert two of their most popular ships—Carnival Vista, Carnival Venezia, and Carnival Mardi Gras—from Grand Turk to their private island destination in the Dominican Republic, Amber Cove. This decision, which has been made without any clear explanation or justification, has significant implications for our island community, local economy, and the livelihoods of our residents.\n\n\n\n\nA Devastating Blow to Grand Turk’s Economy\n\n\n\n\nGrand Turk has long been a cherished port of call for cruise travelers, contributing substantially to our local economy. Our small businesses—restaurants, shops, tour operators, and artisans—depend heavily on the influx of cruise visitors.\n\n\n\n\n The sudden removal of these ships from our shores means a loss of revenue, potential business opportunities, and decreasing the viability of many existing businesses. Many local entrepreneurs had already prepared for upcoming cruise visits; now, they are faced with refunds and the collapse of planned transactions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Did Grand Turk Do to Deserve This?\n\n\n\n\nIt is perplexing and frustrating that no red flags or issues have been raised about Grand Turk that would justify this abrupt removal. Our island has maintained good relations with cruise lines, and our safety, and hospitality standards meet all necessary requirements. There appears to be no justifiable reason to replace Grand Turk with Amber Cove, aside from corporate strategic decisions that overlook the interests of our people and our community.\n\n\n\n\nQuestioning the Role of the New Government\n\n\n\n\nThis decision raises critical questions about the role and awareness of the recently elected PNP government. Yes, our people voted to “keep it where you got it”, but I am sure they did not expect their government to abandon them so quickly. Did they have prior knowledge of Carnival’s plans? I am sure that there was some communication. Were there negotiations or trade-offs made behind closed doors that favoured other interests over our local community?\n\n\n\n\nIt is imperative that the government be transparent about their position and actions regarding this matter. They have been hiding their dealings and agreements with Carnival Cruise Line from the inception of this deal. Our people deserve to know whether the government actively advocated for the preservation of cruise visits to Grand Turk or if they were simply left in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Measures Are Being Taken?\n\n\n\n\nIn light of this setback, I call on the government to outline the measures they are putting in place to support affected local businesses and the broader community. Immediate assistance, such as financial aid or alternative tourism initiatives, should be considered to mitigate the economic impact. Our young entrepreneurs, who already face numerous challenges, should not be left to bear the brunt of decisions made without their input or consideration.\n\n\n\n\nA Call for Accountability and Action\n\n\n\n\nAs opposition leader, I urge the government to engage in urgent dialogue with Carnival Cruise Line to understand the rationale behind this change and to advocate for the reinstatement of Grand Turk as a port of call. Our island’s future depends on proactive measures, transparency, and a commitment to ensuring that our community benefits from the tourism industry, rather than losing out due to corporate decisions made elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nGrand Turk has always been a vibrant and welcoming destination, renowned for its rich history, stunning landscapes, and warm hospitality. We must stand united in demanding accountability and action from our leaders to protect our economy and the livelihoods of our people.

141	Police Condemn “Senseless Killing” of Haitian National in Blue Hills	4	https://www.newslinetci.com/post/police-condemn-senseless-killing-of-haitian-national-in-blue-hills	2025-04-27 16:40:43.274-04	The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force (RTCIPF) has strongly condemned the "senseless killing" of 43-year-old Haitian national Fritznel Beliard, who was gunned down early Sunday morning, April 27.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to police reports, officers from the Tactical Unit were on patrol at approximately 12:30 a.m. when they responded to reports of gunfire at Ralph Close Evangelic Yard in the Blue Hills community. Upon arrival, they discovered the unresponsive body of a male victim behind a wooden apartment structure.\n\n\n\n\n Beliard, originally from Limbe, Haiti, was found suffering from apparent gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary investigations suggest that a group of individuals had gathered in the yard, playing music and socializing, when two armed men approached them. The group dispersed in panic, fleeing in different directions as gunshots rang out. Shortly afterward, Beliard was found fatally wounded.\n\n\n\n\nThe RTCIPF has yet to establish a clear motive for the shooting and has stated that all angles are being explored as the investigation continues.\n\n"This was a senseless act that resulted in the tragic loss of life," the police said in a statement. "We extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Beliard’s family and friends during this difficult time."\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Individuals can contact the nearest police station, dial 911, reach out to the Serious Crime Unit at 231-1842, or anonymously report tips via Crime Stoppers at 1-800-8477. Information can also be shared through the Crime Stoppers P3 app.\n\n\n\n\nPolice are emphasizing the importance of community cooperation to ensure that those responsible for this heinous crime are brought to justice.	\N	2025-04-27 18:21:45.510488-04	2025-04-28 19:17:51.756616-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_1271a909c41c4fbda40714d7193a4c12~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_735,h_491,al_c,lg_1,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_1271a909c41c4fbda40714d7193a4c12~mv2.png	Vivian Tyson, NewslineTCI Editor	\N
138	Thousands Protest In Haiti To Denounce A Surge In Gang Violence And Demand Security	2	https://suntci.com/thousands-protest-in-haiti-to-denounce-a-surge-in-gang-violence-and-demand-p12547-135.htm	2025-04-08 00:00:00-04	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Thousands of protesters clashed with police on Wednesday as they denounced a surge in gang violence and demanded that the government keep them safe.\n\nSome demonstrators brandished machetes while others clutched tree boughs or waved palm fronds as they weaved their way through the streets of Port-au-Prince, where schools, banks and other businesses remained closed.\n\nFlaming tires blocked roads as protesters chanted “Let’s go, let’s go let’s go, and get them out!”\n\nOne of the organizers, who covered his face and declined to give his name for fear of reprisal, said the purpose of the protest was to “take over the prime minister’s office and burn down the CPT,” referring to the offices of Haiti’s transitional presidential council.\nIt is the first major protest to hit the administration of Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, whom the council appointed as prime minister in November.\n\nAs protesters gathered outside his office, police fired tear gas and dispersed them, although some refused to run and instead pelted officers with rocks.\n\nDiscontent and anger is spreading as gangs that already control 85% of Port-au-Prince pillage once-peaceful communities in a bid to seize control of even more territory.\n\nRecent gang violence has forced more than 60,000 people to flee their homes in one month alone, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.\n\n“We have never observed such large number of people moving in this short time,” said Grégoire Goodstein, the organization’s chief in Haiti.\n\nIn a visit to Port-au-Prince in early March, William O’Neill, the U.N. human rights commissioner’s expert on Haiti, described the capital as “an open-air prison.”\n\n“There is no safe way to enter or leave the capital except by helicopter,” he said. “Gangs are invading previously safe neighborhoods, killing, raping and burning houses, businesses, churches and schools.”\n\nGangs also have pillaged communities beyond Port-au-Prince.\n\nOn Monday, they attacked the city of Mirebalais in central Haiti. They stormed a prison, releasing more than 500 inmates as hundreds of residents fled their homes.\n\nA recent U.N. report found that more than 4,200 people were reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured.\n\nO’Neill has called on the international community to do more to support a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that is helping Haitian officers quell gang violence.\nHowever, the mission only has about 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned and has struggled to hold back gangs.	\N	2025-04-27 18:18:15.337091-04	2025-04-28 19:44:36.948745-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/6UvSvwatTB-agdG-M-oNLA.png?exp=1745970276&sig=1a576bc7275b5403cd78b57460a21f424ad7428361e360c3ab9b6d17dc48b16d	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/6UvSvwatTB-agdG-M-oNLA.png?exp=1745970276&sig=1a576bc7275b5403cd78b57460a21f424ad7428361e360c3ab9b6d17dc48b16d
150	Voices from the Streets Part 50- The Conversation Continues!	4	https://www.newslinetci.com/post/voices-from-the-streets-part-50-the-conversation-continues	2025-04-14 12:40:03.564-04	By Nixon Dickenson\n\nIn this week’s article, I would like to share my conversation with Dawshawndre Deane, a promising young man and proud Fisheries Officer.\n\n\n\n\nDawshawndre began our conversation with the saying, "There is more than one way to skin a cat."\n\n\n\n\nHe believes that the level of crime in our communities cannot be solved by one person alone; it requires addressing the root causes of the complex issues that lead to conflicts between young men in neighbouring communities.\n\n\n\n\nDawshawndre emphasized that a major concern with violence nowadays is the case of mistaken identity and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also expressed his worry that many of our youths are imitating what they see on social media. This, he says, calls for more parental intervention in supervising their children’s screen time. He believes that more conversations can help young people distinguish between reality and fiction.\n\n\n\n\nThe reality is that too many of our young people are turning to violence instead of making better choices. Dawshawndre is a strong supporter of entrepreneurship programs and trade schools. He shared that this is an optimal time for the country to present such opportunities to its citizens, as many individuals can benefit from learning a trade. This will help empower them and teach them how to become business owners, thereby developing our most valuable resource: our people.\n\n\n\n\nHe shared that nothing good in life comes easy, but with the right attitude and the right circle of support, anything is possible. Unfortunately, many people who find themselves ensnared by crime live in communities where it has become a way of survival. Dawshawndre called on the government to provide young people with more opportunities to earn a livelihood so that they do not feel hopeless and without options. He expressed that it is time to break the chains of oppression and discover one's purpose and identity. The concept of thugs and gangsters has left many homes broken, many children orphaned, and the graveyard filled with much talent. He expressed that he is a follower of “Voices From the Streets” and believes it is making a difference in keeping the conversation going about addressing crime in our country.\n\n\n\n\nDawshawndre's appeal to young people is clear: the choice is yours; you have the power to think before you act. During our conversation, he shared profound insights into the complexities of crime and the challenges faced by young people. His emphasis on addressing root causes, the influence of social media, and the importance of parental supervision highlight the multifaceted nature of these issues. His advocacy for entrepreneurship programs and trade schools highlights the importance of empowering individuals and providing them with opportunities to succeed and thrive.\n\n\n\n\nHe reminds us that success is attainable with the right attitude and support and calls on the government to create more avenues for young people to earn a livelihood. His appeal to break free from oppressive circumstances and redefine one's identity is a powerful message to all. The devastating impact of gang culture serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for change.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, his message to young people is clear: the choice is yours; you have the power to think before you act. His words inspire hope and encourage us to work together towards a brighter, safer future for our communities. In our country, where crime and violence often dominate the headlines, he stands out as a beacon of hope and a voice of reason. Keep doing well, Dawshawndre!	\N	2025-04-27 18:22:16.325451-04	2025-04-27 18:22:16.325451-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_4f29583e09c3480795a615df5538d429~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_987,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_4f29583e09c3480795a615df5538d429~mv2.jpg	NewslineTCI	\N

While Leger received a life sentence, he will be required to serve a minimum of 22 years, six months, and 21 days before he becomes eligible for release from the prison system.\n\nThe verdict follows Leger’s conviction on March 4, 2025, for the murder of 21-year-old Wilson Jr., who was fatally wounded on the evening of September 29, 2023, during a celebratory event at Governor’s Beach in Grand Turk.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the immediate response by officers at the scene and efforts to transport Wilson to the Cockburn Town Medical Centre, the young man sadly succumbed to his injuries while receiving treatment.\n\n\n\n\nLeger was formally charged with murder on October 4, 2023, after a comprehensive investigation and consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nAuthorities described the case as particularly challenging but reiterated their unwavering commitment to justice.\n\n\n\n\n“This case has been challenging, but our officers have remained committed to seeking justice,” a police spokesperson said. “We understand the pain and loss experienced by many in our community and urge all young people to reflect on their choices. Before making any decisions, consider the impact they could have on your life and the lives of others. Violence destroys more than it solves, and peace can provide a lasting solution.”\n\n\n\n\nTo those still awaiting justice, the message was clear: “We haven’t forgotten you, and we remain dedicated to bringing peace and closure.”\n\n\n\n\nThe sentencing brings some measure of resolution to a case that deeply impacted the Grand Turk community and serves as a sobering reminder of the tragic consequences of violence.	\N	2025-04-27 18:22:28.583319-04	2025-04-27 18:22:28.583319-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_52f8f8617c68488db944aaa0c9162024~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_493,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_52f8f8617c68488db944aaa0c9162024~mv2.jpg	NewslineTCI	\N

Upon arrival, police discovered a white Suzuki Swift precariously positioned atop the roundabout sign, with extensive damage to the vehicle’s front end. The impact was so severe that the car's engine block had become dislodged and was lying on the ground.\n\n\n\n\nPolice initially found no one inside or near the vehicle.

A part from being a good buddy of mine, I admire Efrem’s tenacity. Too often we wait until someone has died to recognize their value. I also admire Efrem’s resilience; twenty-four years ago, he had big dreams.\n\n \n\nEfrem wanted to become an Architect and open a small business in architectural building design. Although his dreams were shattered due to an automobile accident that almost took his life and left him with mobility challenges, he identified a way to make a comeback. Whenever I pass by Scotiabank on Leeward Highway, I look forward to supporting Quench, a small business, as it embodies the power of resilience. Efe understands that he has a purpose in life and uses every opportunity to share lessons that can make a difference in someone’s life.\n\n \n\nHis words of advice to the youth were always to strive to make a comeback and not dwell on circumstances or situations beyond one's control. He said that there is nothing to be ashamed of in making an honest living, even if you are selling cold drinks from the back of your vehicle. Efrem spoke of the many opportunities available to youths in the country, and it will take discipline, determination, and focus on the part of those individuals who want to become successful.\n\n \n\n He shared that the process of learning to walk again was not an easy one. He could have become a pessimist but rather chose to see the bigger picture: that he was alive and that God had a purpose for his life. According to Efe, you will get out of life what you put into it. He shared that he is blessed to be allowed to earn his income in front of Scotiabank, and he can interact with so many business owners.\n\n \n\nOver the years, he has established a stable and supportive customer base. He believes that this can be attributed to his positive attitude and determination to remain resilient, even on days when business was slow, or he did not feel like engaging mentally on that day. He shared that he has seen the hand of God in his life, and he feels blessed to be able to support himself financially, even now, despite his mobility challenges.\n\n \n\nEfrem's story is truly inspiring! His resilience and positive attitude in the face of adversity are remarkable. It is wonderful that he has found a way to make a meaningful impact on his community and support himself despite the challenges he has faced. His advice to the youth about the importance of discipline, determination, and focus in achieving success is valuable. His resilience and tenacity to overcome significant challenges, including a life-changing automobile accident and his determination to make a comeback, is a testimony that with faith and trust in God, anything is possible.\n\n \n\nIndeed, it is his faith and belief in his life's purpose that continue to help him see the bigger picture and remain optimistic. Quench is a staple on the island of Providenciales, and he is grateful for the love and support that he receives from his family and customers. Whenever you have a reason to visit Scotiabank on Leeward Highway, stop by Quench and show this brother some love. Well done, my friend Efe! Keep making waves; someone is watching and being encouraged through the power of your resilience.	\N	2025-04-27 18:22:33.94723-04	2025-04-28 19:17:48.704166-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_637de07990cd41a8882c7c2424b75130~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_555,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_637de07990cd41a8882c7c2424b75130~mv2.jpg	NewslineTCI	\N

The highly anticipated matchups will showcase up to eight bouts, offering a thrilling night for local fans and visiting guests alike.\n\n\n\n\nJarrett Forbes, Director of Sports for the TCI Sports Commission, expressed his excitement about the event, calling it “a great initiative and a valuable opportunity for two countries to come together.” The showcase brings youth boxers from Canada and TCI into the ring for a weekend of competition, camaraderie, and cultural exchange.\n\n\n\n\n“This is about strengthening youth sports and giving our kids exposure and experience in fighting,” said Forbes. “The boxing club here started about a year ago, and to be at this point so soon is very impressive.”\n\n\n\n\nForbes also paid tribute to local supporters and the late Jim Kelly Joseph, who played a key role in the club’s early development.\n\n\n\n\n “We want to thank all the coaches and volunteers, and remember Jim Kelly, who had a hand in starting this program before his untimely passing,” Forbes added.\n\n\n\n\nWhile TCI has previously hosted professional fights—Forbes recalled one featuring Zab Judah years ago—this is the first of its kind at the amateur level.\n\n\n\n\n“We’ve got five to eight bouts scheduled. It’s going to be exciting for both the fighters and the fans,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nThe local program has seen rapid growth, with up to 50 young boxers training at the Felix Morley Gym on a given day. Forbes emphasized the commitment of the youth and hinted at future plans to expand regional partnerships across the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.\n\n\n\n\nOn the visiting side, Tom Hennessey brings decades of experience to the table. A Canadian boxing veteran who started coaching in 1979, Hennessey currently has athletes on both national and provincial teams.\n\n\n\n\n “We try to get the kids out internationally as much as we can. When this opportunity came up, there was a lot of interest,” said Hennessey.\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian contingent includes six boxers, two officials, and coaches from Ontario—home to over 170 boxing clubs. Hennessey, who also serves on the board of Boxing Canada, sees this as more than just a fight weekend.\n\n\n\n\n“We’re here to build goodwill, meet coaches and officials, and create more opportunities for these kids to grow,” he explained.\n\n\n\n\nAfter TCI, Hennessey’s team is headed to Scotland next month with a dozen young boxers—underscoring his commitment to international development.\n\n\n\n\nThe event is not only a first for the Turks and Caicos Islands but also a symbol of how sport can bridge borders and build lasting partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n“You make us better, we make you better,” said Hennessey. “That’s what these trips are all about.”\n\n\n\n\nAs the bell rings this Saturday night, it's more than just a bout—it’s a blueprint for the future of youth boxing in TCI and beyond.	\N	2025-04-27 18:22:36.491909-04	2025-04-28 19:18:01.793757-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_1dc2fb274d7340358272b00ca123d8d0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_493,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_1dc2fb274d7340358272b00ca123d8d0~mv2.jpg	Vivian Tyson, NewslineTCI Editor	\N

305	Despite fluctuations, real estate market maintains robust growth	1	https://tcweeklynews.com/despite-fluctuations-real-estate-market-maintains-robust-growth-p15004-155.htm	2025-04-25 00:00:00-04	Delana Isles•April 25, 2025\nThe real estate market in the Turks and Caicos Islands is experiencing changes, yet it remains resilient, as demonstrated by the positive performance in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025.\n\n\nA Q1 market report produced by Turks and Caicos Islands Sotheby’s International Realty – released last week - showed a total sales volume of $173.1 million in the quarter, 86 units sold with a $2 million average sale price.\n\n\nThe overall performance in the first quarter demonstrates remarkable growth, with single-family homes standing out as the top-performing category. The average sales price for the quarter has reached $2 million, marking a significant 42.9% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024, where the average sale price was $1.4 million, the report outlined.\n\n\nPresident of Sotheby’s TCI, Joe Zahm said: "Despite current market fluctuations, new opportunities continue to emerge with several projects in development. While we remain cautiously optimistic about the second quarter, this evolving market presents both challenges and potential.” \n\n\nThe Q1 sales pace shows robust activity across all segments, from fresh listings to new transactions, with an increasing number of price adjustments that better reflect market conditions and new inventory filling gaps that existed in previous years, the report outlined. \n\n\nThis quarter, notable sales include homes ranging from $5.3 million to $7.5 million. Additionally, luxury condominiums have seen strong sales from $2.7 million to $4.7 million in re-sales and sales within pre- and under-construction condominium resort projects. \n\n\n"Our brokerage also recorded a record trophy property sale that will be made public later this year, signalling continued investor confidence,” Zahm noted.\n\n\nFor single family homes, total year to date sales were $126 million, 32 units sold at an average price of $3.9 million. \n\n\n"Boosted by the sales of eight trophy homes, which collectively account for nearly $90M in this category, these significant transactions have truly propelled the market forward. These high-end properties, including Villa 4 at \nThe Loren at Turtle Cove, Conched Out on Long Bay Beachfront, Jewel Estates on Sapodilla Bay, Villa 7 at Beach Enclave Long Bay, and a Pine Cay Oceanfront Home, represent a diverse range of luxury real estate offerings and foundation of the success in this quarter,” the report said.\n\n\nContributing 20% of the total sales volume, condominiums recorded a total sales volume of $34.2 million, with 23 units sold at an average price of $1.5 million. \n\n\n"Nearly doubling the performance of the previous year, the Condominium category contributed 20% of the total sales volume this quarter, underscoring its strong performance and highlighting the continued appeal of this segment.”\n\n\nThe report further stated that with several unsold and pending transactions in developments such as The Strand, South Bank Boathouses, The Loren at Turtle Cove, Andaz Turks and Caicos, and St. Regis Residences, the outlook for luxury condominiums "remains promising” in the coming months.\n\n\nAmong the top sales this quarter, notable transactions included The Palms, The Ritz-Carlton Residences and West Bay Club. \n\n\n"These sales delivered strong returns, reinforcing luxury condominiums as the standard-bearers for luxury Turks and Caicos real estate assets. With growing interest and new developments underway, the sector's future outlook is solid,” the market report outlined. \n\n\nMeanwhile, land sales come in at $12.1 million total year-to-date sales volume. According to the report, 30 parcels were sold at a $403,000 average sales price. \n\n\nAccording to the report, the opportunity is there in the land market: "Despite underperforming this quarter, the land category still offers numerous prime opportunities across the islands for developments and trophy villa compounds.” \n\n\nZahm stated that beyond Providenciales, South Caicos is gaining significant attention. "With direct American Airlines flights now connecting Miami to South Caicos International Airport (SXC), this hidden gem has become far more accessible.”\n\n\nHe said this development, along with the upcoming Salterra Resort and two new ultra-luxury estates on the Caicos Banks at Sailrock Resorts, will enhance the island's appeal as both an investment opportunity and an exclusive retreat destination. \n\n\n"The real estate market in the Turks and Caicos continues to gain momentum as a high-growth market and stable luxury destination, with total sales volume reaching $173,090,548 this quarter, a 23% increase over last year ($141,166,906 in Q1 2024).”	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-27 23:28:56.720447-04	2025-04-28 19:12:16.67567-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/tlA2E2rsSs6RHf7ozf43ew.png?exp=1745897336&sig=824d2b08236448e0048a05764338fe19652d1d3b9c5e324070f7c77d3ecd56fd	Delana Isles•	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/tlA2E2rsSs6RHf7ozf43ew.png?exp=1745897336&sig=824d2b08236448e0048a05764338fe19652d1d3b9c5e324070f7c77d3ecd56fd

Key features included a luncheon showcasing dishes prepared with locally sourced ingredients; a curated display of agricultural products; and an exclusive ‘meet and greet’ session with local farmers.\n\n\nThe occasion also provided chefs and culinary professionals with the opportunity to engage directly with farmers, gain insight into the variety of produce available locally, and explore methods to integrate fresh, local ingredients into their culinary offerings.\n\n\nPremier Charles Washington Misick attended the event and shared some insights on his social media account.\n\n\n"On Earth Day, I had the great pleasure of joining the Department of Agriculture at the ‘Savouring Local’ event … from farm to table, this event reminded us of the power we hold when we choose to grow and consume locally. Every meal served today was prepared using fresh, homegrown produce – proof that our soil can feed us, our hands can sustain us, and our communities can thrive together,” the Premier shared. \n\n\nHe said he remains committed to addressing the pressing issue of food security in the TCI. "Growing our own food is more than a sustainable practice, it is a critical solution to reducing our dependence on imports, strengthening our economy, and ensuring that every household has access to healthy, affordable food.”\n\n\nMisick is calling on citizens and residents to join in with his government in making the Turks and Caicos Islands food secure. \n\n\n"Let this inspire us to dig deeper, plant more, and support our local farmers. Together, we can build a resilient food system that not only nourishes our people but also protects the natural beauty and resources of the TCI,” he encouraged. \n\n\nIn his Earth Day message, the Premier stated: "Today, as we join the world in observing Earth Day, we are reminded of our responsibility to protect and preserve the natural beauty that defines the Turks and Caicos Islands. From our crystal-clear waters to our vibrant reefs and pristine beaches, our environment is a true gift, one we must safeguard for future generations.”\n\n\nPointing to this year’s theme, Planet vs Plastics’, Misick said it challenges all to reflect on how their choices impact the environment. "Our future, and much of our prosperity, depends on the health of our ecosystems.”\n\n\n"I reaffirm my government’s commitment to sustainable development, conservation, and environmental stewardship. Protecting our reefs, reducing pollution, and advancing renewable energy are promises we make to our children and grandchildren.”\n\n\nHe said true progress, however, requires the cooperation of all. "By reducing plastic use, supporting reef-safe practices, and caring for our communities, we each have a vital role to play.\n\n\n"Together, we can protect our islands for generations to come.”	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-27 23:31:19.860383-04	2025-04-28 19:12:17.630544-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/VByZFKA5TKml10ALHKeweg.png?exp=1745897479&sig=edb97b77748a2fd45a3f6506a04ed90867bddc46846227d286f7e2e8bbf07636	Delana Isles•	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/VByZFKA5TKml10ALHKeweg.png?exp=1745897479&sig=edb97b77748a2fd45a3f6506a04ed90867bddc46846227d286f7e2e8bbf07636

We welcome over 1 million visitors each year, a testament to their trust and confidence in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nAs your Premier, I want to make it clear that our Government is committed to taking decisive and comprehensive action to preserve the safety and security of our nation.\n\nWe do not target US citizens or any other nationality; any contrary statements are without merit. Our independent justice system upholds the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of nationality, whilst maintaining the security and integrity of our Islands.\n\nLaws are debated and passed in this honourable house. In the case of the Firearms (Amendment) Ordinance 2022, this was passed unanimously at a time and in an environment when our country was facing an unprecedented spike in violent gun crimes, which resulted in the threat of destabilizing the economy and the striking of fear in the hearts of residents and visitors.\n\nTo protect our people and the Turks and Caicos reputation as one of the safest places in the world, we had to stiffen penalties as a deterrent against violence and gun crime. Hence, the mandatory minimum sentence moved from 7 to 12 years, and a fine for possessing firearms and ammunition is also compulsory. In exceptional circumstances, judges can impose a custodial sentence of less than 12 years and a fine that they consider fair and just in accordance with sentencing guidelines in each case.\n\nTo date, no US citizen has received the mandatory minimum sentence of 12 years. The TCI does not manufacture firearms or ammunition. However, the number of firearms finding their\n\nway to the Turks and Caicos has increased. Illegal firearms have committed all of the gun crimes; statistics show that between 1st January 2018 and 15th May 2024, the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force seized a total of one hundred and twenty-five firearms of various types and calibres.\n\nA total of three hundred and ten individuals (310) were taken into police custody for firearm-related offences, which included possession of ammunition from 1st January 2018 to 15th May 2024.\n\nA total of one hundred and ninety-five (195) persons have been sentenced in the TCI for firearm or firearm-related offences. Turks and Caicos Islanders account for the majority of the convictions. Seven (7) USA citizens have received sentences for firearm-related offences in the TCI.\n\nAs in any modern democracy, the TCI has three branches of Government: the legislature makes the law, the police and the office of public prosecution enforce it, and the court is responsible for administering justice. I have complete confidence in the Turks and Caicos Islands’ judicial system.\n\nThe operation of legislation is under constant review to ensure that it meets its objective, is balanced and proportionate to the nature of the offence committed and gives judges discretion based on sentencing guidelines; the same is happening in this case. The law must be applied even-handedly, and no special carveout should be made for any particular group of persons.\n\nThe Government is committed to ensuring that justice is done without undue delay and will continue to make every effort to ensure that the judiciary is properly resourced to carry out its functions.

350	GOVERNOR’S RESPONSE TO ABC NEWS INTERVIEW	7	https://gov.tc/pressoffice/latest/governors-response-to-abc-news-interview	2024-05-22 00:00:00-04	The Turks and Caicos Islands values its warm relationship with the United States and welcomes over 1 million visitors each year. Our countries have close ties and work in strong partnership to tackle shared threats in the region.\n\nIn the spirit of respect for this relationship, the Hon. Premier and I received a US Congressional Delegation to listen to their concerns about five US Nationals charged and on bail for the possession of ammunition offences. US Congressman Guy Reschenthaler’s commentary on ABC news following the meeting is highly regrettable. His characterisation of our meeting is not one we recognise. Our discussions were professional and respectful with a focus on clarifying the legal position and the well-being of the individuals.\n\nA mandatory minimum sentence of 12-years and a fine for possession of firearms and/or ammunition is in place to serve and protect all who reside and visit the Turks and Caicos Islands. The law provides discretion in exceptional circumstances for the judge to impose a reduced custodial sentence less than the 12-years and a fine that is fair and just for each case. To date, no US National has received the mandatory minimum sentence of \n12-years. \n\nWe do not target US Nationals and any statements to the contrary are without merit. Our independent justice system upholds the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of nationality, whilst maintaining the security and integrity of our Islands. All five US Nationals are on bail with reporting conditions and are receiving US consular support. Three have pled guilty and two will enter their pleas within the next two weeks.\n\nLike the United States, we have a constitutional separation of the executive and judicial branches. There is no remit for the Turks and Caicos Islands Executive nor the UK Government to intervene or comment on ongoing legal cases before the courts.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies apply professional standard operating procedures for processing matters through the legal system and will investigate any concerns where it is felt standards were not met. There have been no United Nations sanctions against His Majesty’s Prison Grand Turk. A February 2024 Turks and Caicos Islands Human Rights Commission report was positive with no findings against prisoner conditions.\n\nI appreciate the Congressman is concerned for his constituent, but the situation calls for respectful dialogue that guards against misrepresentation. It is important there is respect for due process and for public servants to perform their duties without fear or compromise. The rule of law is paramount and all are equal before the law.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands continues to welcome all visitors to enjoy our Beautiful by Nature Islands.

Children enjoyed a variety of activities such as egg hunts, face painting, sack races, musical chairs, and other traditional games.\n\nCommenting on this year's festivities, Deputy Governor Her Excellency Anya Williams said: “It was such a joy to see the smiles and excitement of the children at this year’s Easter Egg Hunt. Now in its third year, this event has become a staple on Grand Turk’s Easter calendar. It was wonderful to engage with so many children and members of the community. While we thoroughly enjoyed the presence of the Easter Bunny, I reminded the children that Jesus is the real reason for the season and wished them and their families a blessed and enjoyable Easter.”\n\nThe event continues to grow in popularity and has become a cherished tradition for families across the island.	\N	2025-04-27 17:49:55.377082-04	2025-04-28 19:12:58.760189-04	https://suntci.com/22-04-2025-10-11-41-am-9519243.png	Unknown Author	\N
86	Historic First: Arielle Neely Becomes First Turks And Caicos Islander To Speak At United Nations ECOSOC Youth Forum	2	https://suntci.com/historic-first-arielle-neely-becomes-first-turks-and-caicos-islander-to-sp-p12592-129.htm	2025-04-15 00:00:00-04	April 2025 will mark a historic milestone for the Turks and Caicos Islands as Arielle Neely becomes the first-ever TCI national to speak at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum.\n\nHeld annually at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the ECOSOC Youth Forum provides a vital platform for young leaders from around the world to engage with Member States and stakeholders to share perspectives, shape policy, and influence action under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2025 Forum, themed “Advancing sustainable, inclusive, science- and evidence-based solutions for the 2030 Agenda,” aims to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nArielle Neely has been selected to speak during the Caribbean Regional Breakout Session on SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, which will take place on April 16th, 2025, from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. Her participation not only represents a personal achievement but a groundbreaking moment for the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThis global invitation came while Ms. Neely was attending the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London, another prestigious gathering that brings together youth leaders from across the Commonwealth to share ideas, shape policies, and foster leadership development. In fact, Arielle also ran for Commonwealth Youth Council Vice-Chairperson for Policy and Advocacy in October 2024. Though she did not win, she describes the experience as a “valuable stepping stone and learning opportunity in my journey of public service and advocacy.”\n\nMs. Neely, a proud Rotaract member, is passionate about youth development and employability. She currently serves as the Career Advancement and Program Coordinator for the National Internship and Apprenticeship Program (NIAP) and has been working with the program since 2022 as the Research and Planning Officer. Under her leadership, the program has aligned over 200 tertiary-level students with career-aligned placements, bridging the gap between education and the workforce. Her work with NIAP is now being shared on a global stage, reinforcing the program's success as a viable solution to youth unemployment and underemployment.\n\n“It’s hard to put into words what this moment means to me,” said Neely. “To be able to share the work we’ve done through NIAP with the world is deeply personal. As an Overseas Territory, we’re often left out of global conversations simply because we’re not independent—but our young people have so much to offer. I’m incredibly humbled to stand in this space, not just for myself, but for every young person in TCI who deserves to be seen, heard, and given a chance.”\n\nBefore ECOSOC, Ms. Neely was also a panelist at the Caribbean Regional Youth Dialogues, where she and other Caribbean youth leaders discussed key challenges and presented concrete solutions for advancing SDG 8. She highlighted NIAP as a replicable model that tackles brain drain, skills mismatches, and joblessness among youth across the Caribbean.\n\nArielle Neely is no stranger to youth development and policy advocacy. She is the former Female CARICOM Youth Ambassador for the Turks and Caicos Islands and has represented TCI at numerous international forums, including:\n\n● The Debate Mate International Program in Nepal (2024)\n● The HACSA Sankofa Young Fellowship in Ghana (2023)\n● The Caribbean Youth Leaders’ Summit in Trinidad and Tobago (2023)\n● The International AIDS Conference in Canada (2022)\n● The National Policy Working Group in TCI (2022)\n\nHer academic background is equally impressive. She holds a BA (Hons) in Education Studies from the University of Hull and a Master’s in Strategic Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). She also holds a Certificate in Teaching English as a foreign language and is trained in cultural sensitivity and cross-cultural communication.\n\nAmong her accolades, Ms. Neely is the recipient of the 40 Under 40 Award from the Turks and Caicos Islands Government and was named one of the 35 Under 35 by the Caribbean Regional Youth Council. She is also the creative mind behind the internationally recognized #DontRushChallenge, which went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic and featured in outlets like Teen Vogue and HuffPost Canada.\n\nWith an unwavering commitment to advocacy, communication, and strategic development, Arielle Neely continues to build pathways for young people not only in TCI but across the Caribbean and beyond.\n\nLink:https://ecosoc.un.org/en/what-we-do/ecosoc-youth-forum/about-youth-forum/ecosoc-youth-forum-2025	\N	2025-04-27 18:15:19.326957-04	2025-04-28 19:13:36.244692-04	https://suntci.com/15-04-2025-10-36-16-am-5872042.png	Unknown Author	\N

I am yours. You are mine,” Smith said at a ceremony along a section of 59th Street which now bears his name.\n\nHe reminisced about learning the values of hard work and education from his mother and father before hitting it big as an actor and rapper.\n\n“Nobody gets an easy ride,” he said. “That was one of the things these streets of Philadelphia taught me: that there’s nothing wrong with a hard day’s work.”\n\nAmong those who came out to see him was a former teacher who was the first to call him “Prince Charming” — a nickname he adapted for 1990s TV show The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, in which Smith played a teenager from Philadelphia who goes to live with wealthy relatives in Los Angeles.\n\n“The name The Fresh Prince was coined in that building,” Smith said, pointing back at Overbrook High School. “I added the ‘fresh’ because it was hip-hop slang.”\n\nSmith will release his fifth studio album, Based On A True Story, on Friday. It is his first music project in two decades since Lost And Found.\n\nHe won Grammys for Summertime, Men In Black, Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It and Parents Just Don’t Understand.\n\nHe has also starred in movies including Bad Boys, Men in Black and King Richard.	\N	2025-04-27 18:16:15.295423-04	2025-04-28 19:14:51.739883-04	https://suntci.com/08-04-2025-02-00-49-pm-9752056.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

329	Residents Urged To Take Advantage Of Crown Land Amnesty Before June 2026 Deadline	2	https://suntci.com/residents-urged-to-take-advantage-of-crown-land-amnesty-before-june-de-p12629-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	Residents across Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) have been urged to take full advantage of a landmark amnesty program aimed at helping them secure legal ownership of Crown land—before the opportunity expires on June 1, 2026.\n\nSpeaking as guests on Drexwell Seymour’s Financially Speaking radio show on Tuesday, April 15, 2025, Keisha Lopez, Director of the Crown Land Unit, and Sharon Brown, Deputy Director, outlined the unprecedented measures introduced under the amnesty initiative that was rolled out to bring longstanding leaseholders and informal land occupants into full compliance—while offering them a 50% discount on land valuations and writing off years of back payments.\n\nThe amnesty, they said, is a direct response to decades of delayed or failed lease compliance by many Turks and Caicos Islanders who either let their Residential Conditional Purchase Leases (RCPLs) expire or built on land without following through on lease agreements.\n\n"This is a historic opportunity," Lopez said. "The amnesty allows individuals with residential conditional purchase leases to benefit from getting their freehold title. It's actually going to expire June 2026, and people need to act now to benefit from it."\n\nIn a comprehensive explanation, Lopez detailed the four options available under the amnesty, each tailored to address the complex real-life situations many residents face.\n"The first option is that you have the residential CPLs—residential conditional purchase leases—that have expired. And people, because it has expired, you would be expected to pay the arrears, or the means profits. But under this amnesty, you would not have to pay the arrears or any means profits for the period since it has expired. You're just able to pay for the freehold title."\n\nShe continued, "The second option is where we can give you a long lease. This allows you to have a lease for the duration of your life. So you have the benefits of staying on the property, having a house on the property, and it will be for the duration of your life."\n\nThe third option offers a path for financially struggling residents to pay for the land in installments, rather than in a lump sum—provided the value of the land is above $75,000 and they demonstrate they are unable to qualify for a loan.\n\n"You would have to provide us with proof that you would not qualify for a mortgage or financial assistance," Lopez explained. "And then the installment is put in place to assist you to be able to pay in increments until you have completed the payments."\n\nDeputy Director Brown added, "There are qualifications, because it must also be your principal or primary place of residence. It must be where you are currently residing to be able to benefit from that."\n\nOption four, perhaps the most creative, allows residents to reconfigure or reduce the size of their parcels to a more affordable footprint—like scaling down from an acre to a quarter-acre, to reduce the purchase price.\n\n"You have the option of reducing the size of your parcel so that you can pay for what you are comfortable to pay the freehold title for," Lopez stated.\n\nBrown emphasized, "You need to build a house that's a quarter acre—it’s sufficient for a house. Then you can reduce the acreage. Ask for a reduction of the acreage. Because the value, of course, for an acre is far more than a quarter acre."\n\nThe pair also discussed the origin of the amnesty, which stemmed from a 2022 joint report commissioned by the TCI and UK governments that reviewed the Crown Land Ordinance and the accessibility of land for Turks and Caicos Islanders.\n\n“In that report, we had 146 recommendations as to how to improve our processes, how to make land more accessible to Turks and Caicos Islanders,” Brown explained. “A few of those recommendations are now being implemented through the amnesty.”\n\nAnd perhaps the most striking financial benefit of the program? A 50% discount on the value of the land, along with complete forgiveness of all arrears—for both expired leases and long lease conversions.\n\n“So let’s say you owe for the 20 years,” Brown explained. “Your arrears are written off. Under the amnesty, you write off—let’s say you owed $15,000 for however many years—and you apply under the amnesty to acquire the freehold or a long lease, whichever of the options. Those arrears are written off. So you only have to pay the freehold title value.”\n"And that," Lopez added, "you are getting at a 50% discount."\n\nFor retirees and the elderly, the long lease is especially appealing. Brown clarified that this option is not for everyone but targets those aged 65 and older or those suffering from debilitating illnesses.\n\n“It’s for persons who are 65 years and older, or if you're suffering from a debilitating illness, and like those retirees, you don't have any income. So that's the basis on which you would get a long lease.”\n\nThe officials acknowledged residents’ frustration with the delays in processing applications, often due to bottlenecks in the survey and valuation departments. However, Lopez revealed that the Crown Land Unit has begun outsourcing some of that work to external surveyors and valuers to speed up turnaround times.\n\n“We appreciate that that could take us some time for them to be completed. And what we have done to try to reduce the time is we have engaged external surveyors to assist with carrying out those surveys. We’ve also done the same for the valuation aspect of it,” she said.\n\nThose who apply and are approved now have six months to finalize their acquisition process with financial institutions—an extension from the previous three-month deadline.\nWith over 300 applications already submitted, the Crown Land Unit is urging the public not to wait until the last minute.\n\n“If you have purchased the property or you've acquired a long lease, then all of that is written off,” Brown concluded. “If you have not taken up any of these benefits under the amnesty and the period comes to an end, you will now, once again, owe the government all that rent. But they have to do their part.”\n\nResidents interested in participating in the amnesty program are encouraged to visit the Crown Land Unit offices at Butterfield Square, Providenciales, or the National Land Secretariat Building in Grand Turk for more information and assistance.

In my first 30 days, we will roll out immediate interventions to signal a clear shift in approach, tone, and presence. Enhanced high-visibility patrols in crime hotspots. Joint task force operations targeting illegal weapons and gang violence. A full safety audit of vulnerable public spaces and businesses. A surge in foot patrols, with visible leadership at the forefront, including myself,” he said to a ceremony which was attended by high-ranking officials, including the Governor, Premier Charles Misick, Commissioners of Police from The Bahamas, Shanta Knowles, and the Commissioner of the Jamacia Constabulary Force, Dr. Kevin Blake, and other dignitaries.\n\n“These are not just symbolic gestures. These are strategic actions designed to reclaim control, reassure the public, and reaffirm our commitment to safety. We are a force in action, not in waiting. Let me be unequivocal. We will not tiptoe around threats. We will not wait for violence to reach our doorsteps. We are coming; deliberate, lawful and unrelenting. There will be no alley, crack, crevice, or haven where those who spread fear and bloodshed can hide. This force is no longer reacting but moving with purpose, intelligence, and resolve. We will be uncompromising in our effort against crime.”\n\nIn a ceremony marked by both solemn duty and hopeful promise, Commissioner Bailey, who has more than 40 years of experience in his native of Jamaica, was presented by the Governor with his appointment for a three-year term and administered both the oath of allegiance and the oath of due execution. During his powerful inaugural speech that outlined his vision for transforming the RTCIPF.\n\n“This moment, this movement, must be about more than just plans,” he stated. “It must be about people. It must be about impact. I will not lead from a pedestal. I will lead from the ground, with our officers and our people. I am a man of action, not empty words. My leadership will be defined by results, not press releases. I will lead with Integrity and impact. I am here not for comfort but for change. I am here to push this Force to new standards of excellence, accountability, and pride. It is together that we rise.”\n\n“This Force is 226 years old and has a legacy. But we are not just protectors of the past. We are architects of the future. With faith, discipline, and unity, we will build a police service that is among the best in the region; a Force our people can trust. A Force that criminals will fear.”\n\nIn her remarks, the Governor said Bailey’s appointment of comes at a time when the Turks and Caicos Islands “stands at the crossroads of promise and pressure”.\n\nShe added: “Our economy remains resilient, our people industrious and our natural beauty undeniable - but we must remain vigilant against the forces that seek to undermine our safety and security. Criminal networks are becoming more sophisticated, transnational crime and irregular migration continue to challenge our security architecture and vulnerabilities across the region place us at the sharp end of this fight - the role of our police leadership has never been more critical. The challenges we face are no longer just local. Our response must be strategic, data-driven, intelligence-led and collaborative - across agencies, across borders and above all, with the communities we serve.”\n\n“To that end, the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force must be a beacon of public trust - an institution rooted in fairness, strengthened by community engagement and driven by results. The principles of protection, prevention, enforcement and safeguarding continue to anchor our policing mandate. But how we live out those principles must evolve. We must uphold the highest standards. We must be unforgiving in our zero-tolerance approach to misconduct. And we must build a culture where doing right is the rule, not the exception. To every officer across the rank and file of our police force, wearing the badge must continue to be a source of pride, not of power or privilege. Our communities need to see you, know you and trust you. That begins with how you serve them and how you hold each other to account.”\n\nThe Governor said Commissioner Bailey is a leader whose record speaks to grip and forward-thinking leadership, adding that with his deep experience in law enforcement, a modern approach to policing and a strong belief in community-led safety, he brings to this role a clarity of purpose and a commitment to excellence.\n\n“Your charge is not a light one,” she said, “but it is a noble one. You take on this responsibility at a time of high public expectation and heightened need. The work ahead requires courage, transparency and a willingness to challenge the status quo. Reform is not easy. But bold leadership never is. And yet, I have every confidence in your ability to lead, to strengthen and to transform.”\n\nPremier Hon. Charles Washington Misick, who is a former police officer, said that with the formal appointment of Commissioner Bailey. “we send a strong and decisive message that we are committed to strengthening and modernizing the force's leadership and operational capacity”.\n\nThe Premier added:“ We will support you, but we will also hold you to the highest of policing standard. Because the stakes are too high, and the time is now. Commissioner, Lead boldly. Lead justly. Lead with results. The country is watching. And we believe you are ready.”\n\nHe noted that Commissioner Bailey’s name is already etched across the Jamaica region story of law enforcement.\n\n“(He is) a man whose hands-on leadership, razor-sharp intelligence, and resolute courage have helped to transform policing. From dismantling organized criminal networks to spearheading cutting-edge investigation systems, Commissioner Bailey has shown what policing leadership looks like—not only behind a desk, but on the frontlines. His work in gang suppression, financial crime investigation, and counterterrorism has not only saved lives—it has reshaped the very way one thinks about policing.”	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-28 19:50:50.855858-04	2025-04-28 19:50:50.855858-04	https://suntci.com/28-04-2025-08-47-39-am-9789719.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

Analysts have said this is a response to a more challenging environment both for the company and the broader spirits industry.\n\nNet sales fell 3% from a year ago to $1.04 billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $1.07 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, Brown-Forman expects net sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:39.856968-04	2025-04-28 19:16:39.648977-04	https://suntci.com/12-03-2025-03-10-41-pm-7531752.png	Unknown Author	\N

They have often targeted busses travelling to and from the capital.\n\nThe Taliban gang has its stronghold in Canaan, a suburb in the north of Port-au-Prince.\nThe attack came just days after the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti confirmed that a Kenyan police officer, Benedict Kabiru, had been shot dead in a gang attack.\n\nThe multinational force has been trying to help Haiti's national police regain control of gang-ruled areas but locals say they have so far made little progress.\n\nKabiru was the second Kenyan to be killed while on duty in Haiti.\n\nIn total, more than 5,600 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, according to United Nations figures.\n\nA further 2,212 people were injured and 1,494 kidnapped in 2024, the UN said.	\N	2025-04-27 18:18:03.29779-04	2025-04-28 19:44:47.849829-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/LF8i8cuCTC69_GijTgJCww.png?exp=1745970287&sig=522d29a92f19e76524522caa199dbe9945e6ae4a88661ede91d64ec544023934	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/LF8i8cuCTC69_GijTgJCww.png?exp=1745970287&sig=522d29a92f19e76524522caa199dbe9945e6ae4a88661ede91d64ec544023934

Playa's shares were up 2%, while Hyatt was flat.\n\nThe U.S. hospitality chain, which owns a 9.4% stake in Playa, expects the deal to close later this year.\n\nHyatt said it would identify third-party buyers for Playa's owned properties and expects to gain at least $2 billion from the sale of assets by 2027.\n\nThis is part of Hyatt's asset-light business model, where the operator prefers not to own physical properties but to manage or franchise them.\n\n"Recycling the owned real estate... and retaining management contracts on the hotels should be highly accretive, but also requires time and incremental cost," Jefferies analyst David Katz said.\n\n"Although we do not anticipate regulatory complexities, the process and time to closing also presents incremental, albeit modest risk," he added.\n\nPlaya's portfolio also comprises resorts for rivals such as Hilton Worldwide, Marriott International, Wyndham and UK-based InterContinental Hotels Group's Kimpton brand.\nAn unknown is if Hyatt can convert non-Hyatt flagged hotels to Hyatt hotels, should it sell these properties, Truist Securities analyst Patrick Scholes said.	\N	2025-04-27 18:18:11.151212-04	2025-04-28 19:44:53.917463-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ycHig7E-Q1a6m43odRcXAg.png?exp=1745970293&sig=71e1265ba142d835db35cb6e4ccbc445f0a554a975f8e3ea847512f2bc1bbb5b	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/ycHig7E-Q1a6m43odRcXAg.png?exp=1745970293&sig=71e1265ba142d835db35cb6e4ccbc445f0a554a975f8e3ea847512f2bc1bbb5b

Commissioner Bailey’s family, thank you for your support and sacrifice in enabling Commissioner Bailey to serve; and to Commissioner Blake and Commissioner Knowles thank you for your support and valued partnership in tackling shared threats.\n\nThis morning, it is with great honour that I stand before you to conduct the formal swearing-in of the new Commissioner of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, Mr. Fitz Bailey, who is entrusted with one of the most demanding and vital roles in the public service. It is a moment that reaffirms our collective commitment to safety, justice and the rule of law.\n\nCommissioner Bailey, as you are all too keenly aware, this appointment comes not only as a recognition of your leadership and service, but as a call to lead boldly, to reform fearlessly and to restore trust in an institution that must serve every citizen with fairness, integrity and accountability.\n\nThe appointment of Commissioner Bailey comes at a time when the Turks and Caicos Islands stands at the crossroads of promise and pressure. Our economy remains resilient, our people industrious and our natural beauty undeniable - but we must remain vigilant against the forces that seek to undermine our safety and security.\n\nCriminal networks are becoming more sophisticated, transnational crime and irregular migration continue to challenge our security architecture and vulnerabilities across the region place us at the sharp end of this fight - the role of our police leadership has never been more critical.\n\nThe challenges we face are no longer just local.

The principles of protection, prevention, enforcement and safeguarding continue to anchor our policing mandate. But how we live out those principles must evolve.\n\nWe must uphold the highest standards. We must be unforgiving in our zero-tolerance approach to misconduct. And we must build a culture where doing right is the rule, not the exception.

Reform is not easy. But bold leadership never is. And yet, I have every confidence in your ability to lead, to strengthen and to transform.\n\nAs Governor, I look forward to working closely with you, the National Security Council and Unified Command as we continue to bolster our national response to crime and uphold the values that underpin our democracy.\n\nTo the officers of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force - thank you for your continued service and steadfast resolve. Despite the challenges, there is much to be proud of. I thank you for your commitment to protect and serve our communities, often in the most challenging and uncertain circumstances – your courage and sacrifice, with our multi-agency partners, is to be commended and valued deeply.\n\nI know you will offer your full support to your new Commissioner. Together, we can and we must deliver a safer, more just and more resilient Turks and Caicos Islands. Let us remember, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Today marks a new chapter, let it be defined by integrity, accountability and unwavering service in the delivery of justice and the security of our Islands.\n\nCommissioner Bailey, as you take on this solemn responsibility, as written in Micah 6:8 -\n‘He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.’\n\nIn service to the Turks and Caicos Islands, may you lead with strength and with honour.

For over 40 years, he has served with one unwavering purpose: to protect the people of Jamaica\n\nFrom dismantling organized criminal networks to spearheading cutting-edge investigation systems, Commissioner Bailey has shown what policing leadership looks like—not only behind a desk, but on the frontlines. His work in gang suppression, financial crime investigation, and counterterrorism has not only saved lives—it has reshaped the very way one thinks about policing.\n\nCommissioner, we stand with you. As you take the helm of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, we charge you with a mission that is as sacred as it is urgent: Maintain the public's trust. Disrupt criminal enterprise. And keep our communities safe. We challenge you to lead with courage—not only in the face of danger, but in the face of bureaucracy, complacency, and fear. We expect a force under your leadership to be disciplined, accountable, community-centered, and results-driven.\n\nThis is not a ceremonial role. It is a calling. You are not simply receiving a title; you are taking on a profound responsibility. You carry the hopes of praying mothers, the futures of our youths, and the fundamental right of every citizen to live without fear. We expect you to build a legacy in the TCI rooted in law, order, and transformation—one that will endure long after your time in office.\n\nWe will support you, but we will also hold you to the highest of policing standard. Because the stakes are too high, and the time is now. Commissioner, Lead boldly. Lead justly. Lead with results. The country is watching. And we believe you are ready.\n\nTo our brave officers—our boots on the ground—you are not alone. You have the full backing of this government. You have a commissioner who has stood where you stand. One who knows the risks, understands the weight of the badge, and will lead from the front.\n\nCommissioner Bailey, I am certain that you are aware of the pillars of 21st century policing and is committed to fostering the elevation of policing in the Turks and Caicos Islands, by ensuring that promising officers receive the education, practical training and exposure needed to carry out their duties effectively. We expect that he will see to it that capacity building be an integral part of the transformation of the Force; and with it we will see the optimal use of the tools that are readily available including technology and social media which have proven to be efficacious in ameliorating crime at various levels. Finally, as the chief, you have an obligation to ensure the officers’ wellness and safety throughout the conduct of their duties.\n\nAs I consider our recent history, the words of Greg Boyle ring true: “The power of policing is in the relationship. This can happen only if an officer sticks around for a while.” It is my hope that the relationships you will build will justify your tenure.

333	Remarks By Commissioner Of Police Royal Turks And Caicos Islands Police Force, Mr. Fitz Bailey, On Friday, April 25, 2025.	2	https://suntci.com/remarks-by-commissioner-of-police-royal-turks-and-caicos-islands-police-for-p12637-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	I stand before you today as a man appointed by constitutional mandate and a servant leader—humbled, resolute, and fiercely committed to the sacred duty entrusted tome as Commissioner of Police for the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force.\n\nThis appointment is not simply a personal milestone but a national moment. It represents our collective yearning for Safety, Justice, and Stability. As I accept this role, I do so with my eyes wide open to the enormity of the task and a heart ready to\nserve. I will not flinch in the face of adversity nor retreat from responsibility.\n\nTogether, we will rise to meet this moment. Policing has never been just a job to me; it is a higher calling. It has been a lifelong calling—one that has shaped my values and tested my character.\n\nThis calling now compels me to lead from the front, not merely as an administrator of policy but as a builder of trust, an agent of justice and a servant of the people.\n\nIn this journey, I owe a debt of gratitude. I thank Almighty God for His unceasing guidance.\n\nI thank my family, who have carried me through the storm and the sunshine, for their enduring love and sacrifice. Your support has made this possible, and I will neverforget the foundation you have given me.\n\nI thank the Jamaica Constabulary Force for honing my talents and allowing me to participate in strategic leadership.\n\nBut this moment is not mine alone. It belongs to every officer who wears the uniform, steps into danger when others seek safety, and gives their all without recognition or reward. Our strength as a Force comes from these men and women—from every branch, every role, and every rank.\n\nFrom the Tactical Unit, braving dangerous terrain and hostile environments, to the Marine Branch defending our borders and shores, the Criminal Investigations Branch and Serious Crime Units investigating and delivering justice. The Safeguarding and Protection Unit protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nTo our Special Branch and Intelligence Officers, the Forensic Scene of Crime Unit, the Drone Unit, and the Community Policing Unit, who are actively bridging the gap between the police and citizens.\n\nTo the foundations of the force, the Operation and Response Officers who show up and serve with Pride and Integrity despite the challenges. From the language translators to the 911 operators, who ensure prompt dispatch. The civilian staff in police records, the finance department, the case file unit, the Coroner's department, and the court officers. From our support staff to the cleaners, you remind us that every role matters.\n\nEvery action contributes to a safer Turks and Caicos, especially for the media unit, ensuring we communicate with the public and acknowledge their feedback. Your dedication is not just noticed; it is deeply valued. And if I inadvertently omitted anyone, I thank you threefold.\n\nThis unwavering commitment from within the ranks is precisely why we can navigate any storm. The RTCIPF is like a ship—weathered and tested but resilient.\n\nMy job is to steer it with steady hands through rough waters and into calmer seas. But we cannot chart a new course without addressing the current distrust that has emerged, the testing of public confidence, and the hard questions communities are asking—and rightly so. We must answer—not with excuses but with truth and openness.\n\nThat is why, under my leadership, we will restore Legitimacy not with slogans, but with Service. We will rebuild unity, not through forced compliance, but mutual respect.\n\nLeadership, after all, is not about rank - it’s about responsibility. It is not about being followed - it’s about being trusted. We will listen to our communities, respond to their needs, and hold ourselves accountable for our actions. The people of these islands deserve nothing less. Weill restore trust through unified leadership. Words must lead to action, and action begins now.\n\nIn my first 30 days, we will roll out immediate interventions to signal a clear shift in approach, tone, and presence:\n\n• Enhanced high-visibility patrols in crime hotspots\n• Joint task force operations targeting illegal weapons and gang violence\n• A full safety audit of vulnerable public spaces and businesses\n• A surge in foot patrols, with visible leadership at the forefront—including myself.\n\nThese are not just symbolic gestures. These are strategic actions designed to reclaim control, reassure the public, and reaffirm our commitment to safety. We are a Force in Action, Not in Waiting.\nLet me be unequivocal: We will not tiptoe around threats. We will not wait for violence to reach our doorsteps. We are coming; Deliberate,\n\nThere will be no alley, crack, crevice, or haven where those who spread fear and bloodshed can hide.\nThis Force is no longer reacting but moving with purpose, intelligence, and resolve. We will be uncompromising in our effort against crime.\n\nHowever, while enforcement is critical, it is not the whole picture. We must also build an institution that reflects the values of modern, inclusive, and community-centred policing. Ladies and gentlemen, it is about building a Force for the future.\n\nThat means professional development, structural reform, and a culture shift. It also means correcting long-standing imbalances, starting with gender equity.\nI was shocked and disappointed to discover that this Force had not one gazetted female officer in 2025. That is not a statistic; it is a stain that we must and will erase. We will identify, mentor, and elevate the talented women already serving with excellence. We will make space at the leadership table - because inclusion is not a courtesy but a necessity for legitimacy and success.\n\nWe owe this transformation to the pioneers- Ethel Ingham, Helen Malcolm, Irene Butterfield, Sharon Whittaker, Mary Durham - and every woman in uniform today who deserves the opportunity to lead. Our mission will not succeed solely through enforcement. It is a mission of Partnership with a Purpose. We need partners—government, civil society, business, and, above all, the church.\n\nScripture tells us in Matthew 7:7-8, “Ask, and it shall be given; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened.”\nThis is a call not for passivity but for purposeful partnership. It reminds us that heaven partners with earth to bring justice, order, and peace.\n\nI call upon the church not just to pray for us but to walk with us, engage meaningfully, be a voice for the voiceless, speak out against injustice, and champion healing and unity. We are stronger when faith walks alongside service.\n\nThis moment, this movement, must be about more than just plans. It must be about people. It must be about impact.\n\nI will not lead from a pedestal. I will lead from the ground, with our officers and our people. I am a man of action, not empty words. My leadership will be defined by results, not press releases. I will lead with Integrity and impact. I am here not for comfort but for change. I am here to push this Force to new standards of excellence, accountability, and pride.\nIt is together that We Rise.\n\nThis Force is 226 years old and has a legacy. But we are not just protectors of the past—we are architects of the future.\n\nWith faith, discipline, and unity, we will build a police service that is among the best in the region—a Force our people can trust. A Force that criminals will fear.\nA Force our children can one day lead with pride.\n\nLet us walk this road together—steadfast, undeterred, unshaken and unstoppable.\nThank you, and may God bless the Beautiful by Nature Turks and Caicos Islands.

The chase ended when police successfully intercepted the car. Upon stopping, two male occupants reportedly fled the scene on foot. One suspect managed to escape, but officers apprehended the second individual—later identified as a 16-year-old male.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the arrest, police recovered a pistol fitted with an extended magazine.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the accused’s age, the RT&CIPF has withheld his name and photograph in accordance with legal protocols protecting minors.\n\n\n\n\nThe teen is expected to appear before the Magistrate’s Court next week to answer to the charges. Investigations are ongoing as police continue efforts to locate the second suspect.	\N	2025-04-27 18:22:22.295008-04	2025-04-28 19:17:40.543391-04	https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9f991d_1271a909c41c4fbda40714d7193a4c12~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_735,h_491,al_c,lg_1,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto/9f991d_1271a909c41c4fbda40714d7193a4c12~mv2.png	NewslineTCI	\N
334	TCI Turns To The Bahamas For Answers To Growing Housing Challenges	2	https://suntci.com/tci-turns-to-the-bahamas-for-answers-to-growing-housing-challenges-p12631-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	As housing challenges continue to weigh heavily on families across the Turks and Caicos Islands, government officials say recent efforts to explore practical solutions are beginning to gain momentum—starting with a productive fact-finding mission to The Bahamas.\n\nThe visit, which took place from March 26 to 29, comes at a time when more and more residents are feeling the pinch of limited housing options, soaring rental prices, and prohibitive building costs. Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the TCI has grappled with a worsening housing shortage—one that has now reached a critical point.\n\nMinister of Physical Planning and Infrastructure Development, Hon. Arlington Musgrove, led the TCI delegation on the three-day mission. During the visit, officials engaged with key stakeholders in The Bahamas to learn from their experience and explore collaborative approaches to housing and infrastructure development.\n\n“This trip gave us a clearer picture of what's working elsewhere in the region,” Musgrove shared in a statement following the visit. “We’re focused on identifying approaches that can be adapted to fit our specific needs here in TCI. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but regional collaboration like this is a step in the right direction.”\n\nOne of the key engagements during the visit was a sit-down with Bahamian Minister of Housing, Hon. Keith Bell, and his team. The discussion centered on housing policy, homeownership incentives, and existing projects that aim to make homes more accessible for middle- and low-income families in The Bahamas.\n\nWhile The Bahamas has made progress through policies like government-backed loan programmes and the work of the Bahamas Mortgage Corporation, their team was candid about the ongoing challenges—many of which are familiar to TCI, including land constraints, funding limitations, and regulatory red tape.\n\nThe TCI delegation also met with Robert Cox, Managing Director of the Bahamas Mortgage Corporation, to examine public-private partnerships and sustainable development models. According to the ministry, the exchange offered key insights into long-term housing strategies that prioritize affordability and durability.\n\nInfrastructure resilience was another major focus. During discussions with officials from the Bahamas Ministry of Works, the importance of building with disaster preparedness in mind was highlighted—something that resonates strongly with TCI's vulnerability to hurricanes and other natural threats.\n\nThe mission also included site visits to active affordable housing developments, where the team observed cost-cutting construction techniques and new materials being used to improve both sustainability and durability. These innovations, officials say, could inform future housing efforts back home.\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the trip, the ministry acknowledged that translating these insights into real relief for struggling families will take time. With demand for one- and two-bedroom units in Providenciales far outstripping supply, and a growing shift of properties from long-term rentals to short-term vacation listings, many residents remain in limbo. Add in the rising cost of living across the islands, and the urgency is clear.\n\nStill, the government maintains that initiatives like this mission are part of a broader push to reshape the housing landscape in a meaningful, lasting way. Whether those efforts can deliver timely, tangible results remains to be seen.

335	TCI Department Of Social Development Leads Bold Campaign Against Child Abuse	2	https://suntci.com/tci-department-of-social-development-leads-bold-campaign-against-child-abus-p12634-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	As Child Abuse Prevention Month continues throughout April, the Department of Social Development and Welfare has launched an impassioned campaign to bring the issue of child abuse to the forefront of national consciousness in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). With the theme "Powered By Hope, Strengthened By Prevention," the department has rolled out a powerful series of community engagement efforts, media campaigns, and public events to spark awareness and action.\n\nFrom the outset, the department made it clear: the welfare and safety of every child in the Turks and Caicos Islands is a shared responsibility. Throughout the month, they’ve been unwavering in their efforts to educate the public on recognizing abuse, breaking the stigma of silence, and supporting children and families before harm occurs.\n\nThe campaign officially kicked off on April 1, under the leadership of Director of the Department of Social Development and Welfare, Ashley Adams. Under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Religious Affairs, and Transportation, the department is leading a multi-pronged strategy that includes educational programs, media appearances, and public events aimed at empowering the community.\n\n“Child Abuse Prevention Month is a time for reflection, action, and unity,” said Director Adams in her opening address. “By raising awareness, educating ourselves, and supporting one another, we can empower families, enhance prevention efforts, and inspire hope for a safer and brighter future for our children.”\n\nThe department’s outreach efforts have spanned from the airwaves to the streets. One of the major initiatives has been specialized child safeguarding training sessions offered to key community players such as foster parents, police officers, healthcare workers, and community leaders. These sessions were designed to provide practical tools and knowledge for identifying and responding to abuse.\n\nIn tandem with these workshops, a live-streamed Child Abuse Discussion Panel was held for the general public. This forum, hosted by experts in child welfare, tackled issues like the community’s role in protecting children beyond legal frameworks, the barriers victims face when reporting abuse, and how to shift cultural norms toward zero tolerance for abuse.\n\n“The turnout from major stakeholders and the broader community highlighted a troubling truth: the stigma surrounding child abuse often prevents open dialogue,” Adams stated. “Child abuse is a reality in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and silence only allows it to persist. Most times, persons believe that they are exempted or immune, thinking this will never happen to them. Unfortunately, child abuse knows no boundaries—it transcends race, gender, and socioeconomic status.”\n\nThe department also made significant use of media platforms to extend their reach. Adams and her team appeared on several popular radio and social media shows including VHTC Radio with Donald Metellus, Inspire with Dr. Cutella Talbot, Wassup with Andy Missick, GENFo hosted by Gender Affairs, and Radio Hope with Joseph Vixaille. The interviews offered detailed insights into the causes of abuse, signs to look for, and the process that follows when abuse is reported.\n\n“For those who missed the original broadcasts, these interviews will be replayed throughout the month of April,” Adams shared. “We want to ensure that this information is accessible to everyone.”\n\nAnother powerful aspect of the campaign came through a series of child abuse prevention videos featuring prominent national figures. These included heartfelt messages from Her Excellency the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and Her Ladyship the Chief Justice of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\n“Each message detailed preventative methods from their position,” said Adams. “It was a call to action to the wider Turks and Caicos Islands to show up to the discussions, recognize the signs of abuse and neglect, become informed, and bring awareness throughout our communities.”\n\nLooking ahead, the department has scheduled two major community events. On April 24, South Caicos will host the annual Child Abuse Prevention Softball Match, and on April 30, Grand Turk will be the site of an Island-wide Motorcade. Both events are open to the public and are intended to unite communities through shared purpose.\n\n“As a society, we must collectively commit to breaking the silence, setting aside our differences, and supporting the agencies and individuals working tirelessly to safeguard our children,” said Adams. “Child abuse is a serious concern that demands our collective attention and action. There can be no exceptions, no excuses, and no allowances for ignorance of the law or favoritism based on personal connections.”\n\nEmphasizing the department’s ongoing mission, Adams said that raising awareness isn’t a one-month campaign, but a long-term commitment. The department is calling on businesses, schools, faith communities, government bodies, and individuals to wear blue, participate in events, and continue conversations about prevention throughout the year.\n\n“Child abuse is everyone’s business, a shared responsibility, and we all have a role to play in fostering safe, nurturing environments for our children to thrive,” Adams said firmly.\n\nThe Department of Social Development and Welfare continues to lead the charge against abuse through education, collaboration, and advocacy. As the month progresses, the call is clear: take part, speak up, and protect the future of the Turks and Caicos Islands—its children.\n\n“Every child deserves to grow up in a world where they feel safe, cherished, free to dream, and every family deserves the support to make that a reality,” concluded Adams. “Let us be relentless in our efforts. Together, we can protect our children and build a better, safer TCI.”	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-28 19:51:27.68097-04	2025-04-28 19:51:27.68097-04	https://suntci.com/28-04-2025-09-25-01-am-660915.jpg	By Daisy Handfield•	\N

The changes will be reflected on Carnival.com within 24 hours. We recognize that his is an unexpected change to our original plans, and, in appreciation for your understanding, we are posting a $50, per stateroom, onboard credit to your Sail & Sail account.”\n\nIn August 20024, the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, the Grand Turk Cruise Center (GTCC) and Carnival Corporation reached agreement on new guidelines for public access to the GTCC facilities which reflect the shared desire for residents to continue to enjoy the facilities as well as provide a safe and secure environment for guests, GTCC employees and the Grand Turk community who are visiting.\n\nBy promoting a family-friendly atmosphere, these guidelines were designed to maintain the popularity of Grand Turk with cruise guests, support local businesses and foster a welcoming and business-friendly environment for food, beverage, shore excursion, and retail partners.\n\n“We greatly appreciate the collaborative spirit of partnership from government and cruise center leaders to provide an added layer of security at the Grand Turk Cruise Center facilities, while also allowing residents all opportunities to enjoy the beach, shopping and restaurants,” said Juan Fernandez, vice president of Carnival Corporation’s destination operations.\n\nEffective Thursday, August 15, 2024, visitors from the community will be asked to follow new guidelines and procedures to access the Grand Turk Cruise Center (GTCC):\n\n• During operating hours (when a ship is in port), access to GTCC by the public is only granted to individuals who obtain a one-day identification (ID) badge.\n• Access will be by the main entrance and will be free of charge.\n• An ID badge will be issued to each individual at the GTCC’s main entrance guard gate.\no Individuals 18 years and older must present a valid form of government ID.\no Individuals under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult with a valid form of government ID.\no The ID badge will be issued by officers of the GTCC at the main entrance. Individuals who have violated the code of conduct of the GTCC will be denied entry.\no Any individual on the GTCC premises without an ID badge will be asked to leave immediately and will be referred to law enforcement.\nEach individual seeking entrance must acknowledge and adhere to the Code of Conduct while at the GTCC:\n• Visitors to the GTCC shall not engage in ANY business activities within the port. No sales or solicitation of any kind are permitted. Only tour operators approved by the GTCC, and with official tours sold by the cruise lines, can conduct business on port premises.\n• No illegal activity will take place at the port. This includes but is not limited to narcotics sales or use, theft or attempted theft, assault or threats of assault.\n• Visitors to the GTCC shall not interfere in work activities of GTCC employees or licensed tour operators in good standing with GTCC.\n• Visitors to the GTCC shall not pose a public nuisance that interferes with GTCC employees, guests, or licensed tour operators. A public nuisance is defined but not limited to the obstruction of the public right of way of pedestrian passage, or any act that endangers the morals, comfort level of the public, or obstructs the enjoyment of rights common to all.\n• No weapons of any kind are allowed, which include but are not limited to firearm(s) or knife(s).\n• No use of abusive, offensive, threatening language or behaviors.\n\nAny violations of the above will result in removal from the GTCC property and the revocation of the ID badge by GTCC officers. Violators will also lose the ability to obtain an ID badge for a minimum of three months or higher depending on the severity of the violation.

118	NFL Projects Salary Cap Between $277.5M And $281.5M In 2025, Rising By As Much As $26M	2	https://suntci.com/nfl-projects-salary-cap-between-m-and-m-in-rising-by-as-m-p12351-130.htm	2025-02-25 00:00:00-05	NEW YORK — The NFL salary cap will be between $277.5 million and $281.5 million for the 2025 season, rising as much as $26 million from last year.\n\nThe bump is great news for Cincinnati, which is hoping to sign receiver Tee Higgins to a long-term contract. It also means more money for Minnesota to re-sign quarterback Sam Darnold or Kansas City to bring back guard Trey Smith or Super Bowl champion Philadelphia to keep linebacker Zack Baun.\n\nIt’s also significant for teams projected to be over the cap when the new league year begins in March: Atlanta, Seattle, Buffalo and Cleveland. It might not be enough to save New Orleans, which is more than $50 million over the projected cap and by far in the worst shape heading into 2025.\n\nThe salary cap was set at $255.4 million in 2024, up more than $30 million from the previous year.\n\nThe projected range for 2025 is based on ongoing negotiations between the league and the NFL Players Association. The players union has the right to recover up to 50% of $9 million in deferred payments from 2024, with the remaining amount being recovered in 2026. The final cap figure is expected to be finalized next week.\n\nRegardless of where it ends up, the NFL’s salary cap will have more than doubled since being $123 million in 2009. It was $188.2 million in 2019.	\N	2025-04-27 18:17:02.852617-04	2025-04-28 19:44:42.354952-04	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/SCPx8l_FSMCSr7nWnl0mtA.png?exp=1745970282&sig=4d51973561cef350911d2f50c016bc9421967b16b1c8f3cffaecb28fb44ac893	Unknown Author	https://ideogram.ai/api/images/ephemeral/SCPx8l_FSMCSr7nWnl0mtA.png?exp=1745970282&sig=4d51973561cef350911d2f50c016bc9421967b16b1c8f3cffaecb28fb44ac893

Kennedy Jr. held a press conference on Tuesday, April 22, 2025, unveiling a bold new initiative aimed at improving the quality of ingredients used in processed foods—particularly those marketed to children.\n\n“Too many of our kids are consuming products filled with additives, chemicals, and ultra-processed ingredients that we now know contribute to long-term health problems,” Kennedy said. “It’s time we raise the bar on what we allow in their food.”\n\nThe initiative, still in its early stages, will involve tighter regulation of food labeling, a re-evaluation of approved food additives, and new nutritional standards for packaged products. Kennedy emphasized that the plan is not just about consumer protection but about confronting a major public health crisis.\n\n“We are seeing rising rates of childhood obesity, diabetes, and other preventable illnesses. Much of this can be traced to the quality—not just the quantity—of what kids are eating,” he said.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has raised significant concerns about the rising rates of childhood obesity in the Caribbean, attributing much of the problem to the increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods. These products, often high in sugars, fats, and salt, are replacing traditional, more nutritious foods in the diets of families across the region.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services will work in tandem with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reassess the long list of ingredients currently permitted in children’s food. The review process will include consultations with scientists, pediatricians, and consumer advocacy groups.\n\nA 2019 PAHO report highlighted that sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages in Latin America and the Caribbean grew by 8.3% between 2009 and 2014, with an estimated further increase of 9.2% from 2014 to 2019. This surge has been linked to aggressive marketing strategies and the widespread availability of these products, leading to unhealthy dietary patterns among children.\n\nOne of the most immediate actions proposed includes revisiting GRAS (“Generally Recognized As Safe”) designations, which Kennedy argues have allowed too many questionable ingredients to bypass rigorous testing. He also signaled possible restrictions on marketing unhealthy foods to children.\n\n“This isn’t about banning fun snacks,” Kennedy clarified. “It’s about making sure what’s inside those snacks doesn’t harm a child’s development or health.”\n\nThe move has been met with cautious optimism by public health experts and advocacy groups who have long called for greater transparency and reform in food production. Food manufacturers, meanwhile, are expected to push back, arguing the cost of reformulation could be significant.\n\nNonetheless, Kennedy remained firm: “Children deserve better. Parents deserve to trust that what’s on store shelves is safe. This is about the future of our country’s health.”\n\nMore details on the plan’s timeline and implementation will be released in the coming months.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	**U.S. Health Secretary Robert F.

319	Rwanda and DRC Sign Historic Declaration of Principles in Washington	6	https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/rwanda-and-drc-sign-historic-declaration-of-principles-in-washington/	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	Washington, D.C. – April 25, 2025 — In a major diplomatic breakthrough, the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Rwanda today signed a Declaration of Principles aimed at paving the way for peace, stability, and economic integration in eastern DRC. The ceremony, hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, marks a significant step forward in efforts to resolve longstanding tensions between the two neighboring countries.\n\nForeign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner signed on behalf of the DRC, while Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe signed for Rwanda. They were joined by Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, Senior Advisor for Africa Massad Boulos, and U.S. Ambassador to the DRC Troy Fitrell.\n\nThe signing ceremony builds on the efforts of the African Union and other regional leaders who have long sought to address the complex and often violent conflict in the Great Lakes region. The Declaration of Principles establishes a framework for restoring normal bilateral relations between Rwanda and the DRC, reinforcing commitments to sovereignty, territorial integrity, security cooperation, and regional economic development.\n\n“This is a pivotal moment,” Secretary Rubio said. “The United States is honored to support Rwanda and the DRC as they take this courageous step toward lasting peace and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe Declaration outlines key areas of cooperation, including mutual recognition of each country’s sovereignty and established borders, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and the prohibition of interference in internal affairs. It emphasizes the urgent need to address security threats posed by non-state armed groups operating along the shared border and commits both governments to refrain from providing support to such groups.\n\nTo enhance security, the two nations agreed to explore the creation of a joint security coordination mechanism aimed at combating armed groups and criminal organizations. This cooperation is viewed as essential not only for stability but also for expanding legitimate trade and broader economic collaboration across the region.\n\nIn an ambitious economic vision, Rwanda and the DRC pledged to develop a phased regional integration framework, building on organizations like the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the East African Community (EAC). They plan to link this framework with U.S.-supported investments in infrastructure, hydropower, mineral supply chain transparency, and national park management.\n\nThe Declaration also addresses the humanitarian crisis caused by ongoing conflict. Both countries committed to working with UN agencies to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees.\n\nIn addition, the two countries reaffirmed their support for the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO and other regional mechanisms, ensuring protection for civilians and facilitating the implementation of the principles outlined in the Declaration.\n\nFinally, in alignment with ongoing initiatives such as the Nairobi and Luanda processes, the two governments committed to drafting an initial Peace Agreement by May 2, 2025. Any disputes arising from the draft will be addressed through a Foreign Minister-level meeting in Washington, D.C., hosted by the U.S. State Department.\n\nSigned in duplicate in English, today’s agreement marks a hopeful new chapter in Rwanda-DRC relations, offering a potential blueprint for peace and development across one of Africa’s most conflict-affected regions.\n\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebook	In a **major diplomatic breakthrough**, the Governments of the **Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)** and the **Republic of Rwanda** have signed a **Declaration of Principles** aimed at achieving **peace**, **stability**, and **economic integration** in eastern DRC.

Breaking The Cycle Of Dependency	2	https://suntci.com/economic-justice-breaking-the-cycle-of-dependency-p12641-111.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	A nation cannot thrive when its people are locked out of their own economy. This is a tourism trap.\n\nTCI’s GDP relies heavily on tourism and foreign investment, but profits flow offshore while locals face sky high living costs. For example, expat dominated Airbnb markets inflate housing prices, pushing families into poverty. This mirrors issues in Hawaii and Bali, where foreign ownership displaced native communities.\n\nJob Colonialism: Importing foreign labor for roles locals could fill with training (e.g., healthcare, tech, construction) creates a permanent underclass.\n\nCompare this to Singapore’s model: strict work permit quotas force companies to hire locals first, paired with government funded upskilling.\n\nUnchecked foreign workers with fake degrees or tax free side hustles undercut local businesses. Imagine a TCI carpenter competing against an expat who dodges permits and taxes, it’s economic warfare.\n\nWe need to mandate local hiring quotas for industries like construction and tourism.\nWe need to create a TCI skills fund to train locals in high demand fields (e.g., renewable energy, fintech).\n\nTax foreign owned short term rentals at 30%, reinvesting proceeds into affordable housing.\n\nSocial equity, dignity over displacement\n\nWhen a people lose control of their land, they lose their identity, and their cultural heritage is erased .\n\nForeign driven development often prioritizes resorts over communities.\n\nIn TCI, this risks reducing locals to service workers in a playground built for outsiders. A modern-day plantation dynamic. Indigenous Kalinago leaders in Dominica fought similar battles, demanding land rights to protect their heritage.\n\nWe now face The 10,000 vs. 90,000” Threat: If outsiders dominate voter rolls, locals lose their voice. Britain’s historical “divide and rule” tactics in colonies like Kenya weaponized demographic shifts; TCI must avoid repeating this.\n\nWe need to prioritize land ownership for TCI born citizens, mirroring Barbados’ ancestral land laws. Strengthen voter eligibility rules to for non locals. Rejecting Colonial Legacies.\n\nTCI’s status as a British Overseas Territory leaves it vulnerable to external agendas.\nThe Puppet Governance Problem: Many politicians depend on foreign donors or developers for campaign funds, creating policies that favor outsiders. This echoes Puerto Rico’s struggle with U.S. corporate influence.\n\nConstitutional Weakness: The UK’s veto power over local laws undermines self determination. Compare this to Aruba’s 1986 separation from the Netherlands, which granted full internal autonomy.\n\nTCI Government needs to Demand a new constitution, one that removes UK oversight on immigration and labor laws.\n\nLaunch a Citizens’ Assembly to draft a grassroots vision for TCI’s future, bypassing compromised politicians.\n\nWe must Learn from History.\n\nIndigenous communities globally from Native Americans to Australia’s First Nations, warn us disenfranchisement starts with small concessions.\n\nThe “Sit Small” Agenda Forcing locals into complacency (“don’t rock the boat”) is a tactic to erase resistance. But look at Fiji: after ethnic tensions, they enacted policies reserving certain sectors for indigenous Fijians, ensuring economic sovereignty.\n\nPoliticians cling to donor money instead of representing citizens. Iceland’s post 2008 reforms prove that grassroots movements CAN overthrow corrupt elites if courage outweighs fear.\n\nHon JAGS McCartney and Hon. Michael Misick left a blueprint on how to empower locals:\n1. Education Revolution\nFree vocational training for locals in tourism, healthcare, management, aviation, and tech.\n2.Partner with global universities (e.g., UWI) to offer online degrees subsidized by the Government.\n2. Economic Patriotism\nTCI First Contracts. Prioritize local firms for government projects.\n4.Launch a “Local Innovation Grant” for youth led startups in agriculture or eco tourism.\n5. Audit politicians’ ties to foreign donors.\n6. Whistleblower Protection Act for locals exposing corruption.\n7. A National Heritage Fund to preserve TCI traditions, language, and sites.\n8. Mandate schools to teach TCI history and land rights, ensuring pride and vigilance.\n\nEmpowering locals isn’t just policy, it’s survival.\nWithout action, TCI risks becoming a cautionary tale. A people who traded their birthright for empty promises, watching their home become a tax haven or retirement colony for the global elite.\n\nBut there’s hope. Look at nations like Botswana, which leveraged diamond wealth to build schools and hospitals for its people, not outsiders. Or Mauritius, where strict work permit laws protect local jobs while welcoming VETTED foreign expertise.\n\nTogether we can build a nation for us, by us.\nTo leaders, stop selling our future.\nTo citizens, stop waiting for permission.\nTo the developers, respect our right to exist.\nTo the government, protect your people.\nThis isn’t xenophobia it’s self defense.\n\nA first world TCI starts with empowering the people who call it home.\nChange is possible, but only if locals lead it.\nKeep the dream alive.

Following this discovery, thorough investigations were conducted as officers pursued various leads. One suspected gang member is currently in police custody in connection with the discovery.\n\nCommissioner of Police Fitz Bailey said: “The seizure of these dangerous weapons sends a clear and unequivocal message—we will not tolerate violence and lawlessness in our communities. This significant find has potentially prevented the loss of life and further acts of violence against law-abiding citizens. Our officers remain resolute in their mission to pursue individuals who possess and traffic illegal firearms. Seven firearms have been seized from January 1 to April23rd, 2025. Five of which were pistols.

These shifts are impacting how and when travellers make decisions. While discretionary spending remains strong among many U.S. households, data shows that the perception of financial instability is causing a degree of booking hesitancy, especially for long-haul and premium travel.\n\n“As an industry, we are seeing that the decision-making window has shortened, not as a reflection of weakened demand, but as a result of shifting consumer confidence,” said TCHTA President, James McAnally. “Our members are seeing that while travellers are still willing to spend, they’re booking closer to travel dates, waiting until they feel certain that the conditions are right. This is especially evident in U.S. markets, where socio-political narratives are influencing consumer sentiment in real time.”\n\nDespite this trend, says the TCHTA, Turks and Caicos has several advantages that position it favourably.\n\nTCI’s luxury accommodations continue to benefit from a resilient high-spend traveller demographic. This segment, less impacted by economic contractions, remains committed to quality experiences and has consistently favoured Turks and Caicos for its exclusivity, safety, and service. Additionally, group travel, particularly within the corporate, celebratory, and wedding segments, has shown notable strength without look heading into the summer particularly promising. Of special note, all-inclusive properties are reporting a stronger outlook than traditional resort models heading into the summer.\n\nStill, opportunity lies within the data. With Canadian travel to the U.S. slowing significantly in recent months fueled by a combination of geopolitical tensions, visa entry concerns, and evolving traveller preferences, Turks and Caicos is well-positioned to step forward as a compelling alternative. Direct airlift from major Canadian cities, along with the destination’s longstanding appeal and a bilingual-friendly environment, provides a strategic advantage in courting this market further. The destination’s proximity and premium positioning align well with the travel desires of Canadians seeking leisure without the stress of navigating contentious or restrictive border experiences.\n\nMcAnally stated, “In the face of a shifting global travel landscape, Turks and Caicos remains steadfast in its value proposition: a high-quality, world-class destination with consistent service standards and an unmatched natural environment. As travellers grow increasingly discerning, both in terms of how they spend and where they choose to go, our industry’s ability to clearly communicate our strengths is critical.”\n\nTo that end, the TCHTA says it is proud to support the relaunch and expansion of the #WhyILoveTCI campaign, spearheaded by Experience Turks and Caicos. Originally birthed by the TCHTA in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the hashtag has remained active and resonant across platforms, garnering tens of thousands of impressions across Instagram and Facebook over the years. Its organic origin and authentic tone have kept it alive in the hearts of visitors and locals alike. Now, as Experience TCI breathes new life into the campaign, TCHTA members are leaning in with renewed commitment.\n\n"We recognize the importance of not just reacting to market shifts, but leading through them with creativity and purpose," said Karen Whitt, TCHTA Marketing Chair. "Our partnership with Experience TCI is a reflection of that leadership, and the #WhyILoveTCI campaign is a natural evolution of a story the destination began telling years ago. It’s personal, it’s proven, and it’s perfectly timed."\n\nThe TCHTA says it will continue to engage members and regional partners in shared learning and strategy, recognizing that the factors influencing global travel today are nuanced, interconnected, and fluid. As part of this effort, the Association is strengthening its data collection and forecasting capabilities to support members with more dynamic tools to navigate the months ahead.\n\nConfidently, the organization’s CEO, Stacy Cox said, “As an association, we believe that transparency, data-led insights, and forward momentum are key. This is not a moment to be reactive; it is a time to be visible, proactive, and in control of our narrative. Turks and Caicos is not waiting to see how the market plays out. We are analyzing, adjusting, and advancing.”\n\nThe Turk & Caicos Hotel and Tourism Association represents a wide range of members from resorts and villas to insurance companies and financial service providers, watersports operators, catering outlets, taxi drivers, artisans, and sundry tourism service providers.\n\nThe association aims to assist organizations through networking opportunities, training, promotional activities, and representation at all levels of decision-making in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the region.\n\nThrough involvement and cooperation with our tourism partners, the TCHTA is dedicated to the achievement of sustainable growth in tourism for the benefit of its members and the wider community, while protecting and enhancing the unique character and environment of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Subscribers are urged to continue making their regular contributions, which are essential to ensuring the uninterrupted delivery of healthcare services at the highest standards, both locally and abroad.\n\nInterim Chair of the NHIB, Mrs. Shonia Been, said, “The Board is actively working to maintain a seamless experience for subscribers and providers alike. “We are focused on ensuring that healthcare access remains uninterrupted and that the trust placed in us by the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands is honoured.”\n\nThe NHIB encourages all insured persons, employers, and self-employed individuals to continue making monthly contributions. These payments are critical to sustaining the national health insurance system and enabling the Board to meet its obligations to local and overseas healthcare providers, ensuring that beneficiaries receive the care they need without disruption.\n\nCommenting on the NHIB, the Minister of Health and Human Services, the Hon. Kyle Knowles, stated, “This is a time of renewal and strengthening for the NHIB. While internal assessments are ongoing, the public can be confident that the Board remains open for business and that healthcare delivery is not only stable but being actively protected and improved. We urge all subscribers to continue making their monthly payments, as their contributions directly support our ability to deliver care to every resident who needs it.”\n\nTo further enhance transparency and accountability, contracted examiners, Interpath, have commenced a comprehensive forensic examination of the Board’s operations and financials. This process aims to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the NHIB continues to operate in the best interest of the people.\n\nThe public is further advised that all NHIB offices throughout the Islands are open for business and ready to assist with queries, claims, registrations, and payments. Customer service teams are available to support subscribers and guide them through any concerns.\n\nAs the organisation continues to strengthen its internal operations and governance, it reaffirms its mission to promote the health and well-being of every resident through a fair and sustainable insurance system.

338	Wymara Resort + Villas Achieves Green Globe Certification, Setting A New Benchmark For Sustainable Luxury In Turks And Caicos Islands	2	https://suntci.com/wymara-resort-villas-achieves-green-globe-certification-setting-a-new-be-p12640-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	Wymara Resort + Villas is proud to announce that it has officially been awarded Green Globe Certification, a globally recognized standard for sustainable tourism. Timed with Earth Month, this milestone underscores Wymara’s unwavering commitment to environmental responsibility, community support, and best-in-class sustainable practices — all while delivering luxury with a conscience, a hallmark of the Wymara experience.\n\nIn its inaugural audit, Wymara placed among the top-performing first-time applicants, laying the groundwork for continued progress toward climate-conscious hospitality.\n\n“Achieving Green Globe Certification is a milestone we’re incredibly proud of — it reflects not only our values, but the collective passion and effort of our entire team,” says Shelley Rincon, CEO, Wymara Resort + Villas. “Sustainability has been woven into our DNA since day one, and this certification affirms our position at the forefront of responsible luxury travel in the Caribbean.”\n\nA True Changemaker in Caribbean Hospitality\n\nWymara Resort + Villas isn’t just checking boxes — it’s redefining what sustainable luxury looks like in the Caribbean. With deep-rooted values and a future-focused mindset, Wymara has implemented comprehensive initiatives that not only minimize its environmental impact, but actively invest in the health, culture, and future of the Turks and Caicos Islands — a destination proudly known as Beautiful by Nature.\n\nThis commitment ensures that the island’s pristine beauty, rich marine life, and vibrant community are preserved for generations to come.\n\nFrom eliminating plastics to restoring coral reefs and supporting youth development, Wymara is proof that luxury and sustainability are not mutually exclusive — they’re stronger together.\n\n● Plastic-Free Commitment: Wymara has eliminated single-use plastics resort-wide, including the introduction of wooden key cards and convenient water refill stations located throughout the property, along with other operational changes that remove plastic from daily use.\n\n● Smart Water Management: In a destination where fresh water is limited and often imported, Wymara has taken steps to reduce unnecessary water use in landscaping. Rainbird sensors have been installed throughout the property’s irrigation system to provide precise, real-time readings of soil moisture. These sensors automatically suspend watering when moisture levels exceed preset thresholds — helping to conserve water and reduce strain on local resources.\n\n● Commitment to Marine Conservation: One of Wymara’s most innovative initiatives is its end-of-stay donation program, launched in 2023. Since then, the resort and its guests have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, directly advancing coral reef conservation. In 2025 alone, the program is projected to raise over $140,000. Guests are invited to contribute $5 per night, and select menu items donate 10% of proceeds to the Fund. Wymara’s long-term vision is to inspire other hotels and watersports operators across the islands to adopt similar programs — a collective effort that could significantly change the future of reef preservation in Turks and Caicos.\n\n● Community Investment: $300,000 donated in the past three years to the Edward C. Garland Youth Centre, directly supporting education and youth development on-island.\n\n● Coastal Clean-Ups: Wymara organizes monthly beach clean-up days to protect the surrounding coastline and marine environment. These efforts engage both guests and the local community and reflect the resort’s recognition that its success is directly tied to the preservation of the island’s natural beauty, including the world’s third-largest reef and diverse marine life.\n\n● Sustainable Sourcing: From spa products made with on-site botanicals by The Wildflower Skincare Lab to eco-conscious offerings from 111SKIN, Wymara integrates sustainability into every touchpoint. In the kitchen, menus feature locally caught fish and island-grown produce, reducing the resort’s footprint and supporting regional farmers and fishers.\n\n“The precedent-setting support we have received from Wymara for our coral reef conservation efforts has been instrumental to our ability to expand our operations,” says Alizee Zimmermann, Executive Director of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, the country’s only environmental advocacy NGO. “Coastal and marine ecosystems are culturally valued by the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Wymara Resort + Villas are exemplary when it comes to embodying sustainable practices for all the right reasons.”\n\nSustainability That Goes Beyond the Surface\n\nAs a proud member of Leading Hotels of the World, Wymara’s impact goes beyond sustainability. The executive team champions gender equality, employee development, and cultural connection through mentorship programs, staff training, and partnerships that elevate local artisans and suppliers.\n\nWymara is one of just six resorts in Turks and Caicos to be recognized by Forbes Travel Guide with a Four-Star rating. Now, with Green Globe Certification secured, the resort is doubling down on its pursuit of Five-Star status — blending world-class luxury with meaningful change.\n\nA Global Endorsement of Impact\n\nGreen Globe is the premier global certification for sustainable tourism. Certified members are independently audited based on over 380 criteria, covering everything from energy use and waste reduction to community involvement and biodiversity protection. With increasing pressure on travel and hospitality brands to meet net-zero targets by 2050, Green Globe Certification provides credible, third-party assurance to travelers who care about their environmental footprint.\n\nGreen Globe Certification CEO Birte Pelayo congratulated Wymara Resort + Villas, the newest member of the elite sustainable hospitality community.\n\n“The Caribbean is home to some of the first resorts in the world to achieve certification by Green Globe, and we are excited to welcome Wymara to this elite collection of sustainable hospitality businesses,” said Birte Pelayo, CEO, Green Globe Certification. “From supporting coral reforestation to eliminating single-use plastics and restoring sand dunes and natural ecosystems, Wymara is active and engaged in preserving and improving its holiday destination.”	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-28 19:51:43.34754-04	2025-04-28 19:51:43.34754-04	https://suntci.com/28-04-2025-09-56-09-am-2981194.jpg	Unknown Author	\N

"With BA still flying to the destination, we wanted to ensure that we have secure direct flights from London to Turks and Caicos."\n\nThe eye-catching underground advertisement showcases the destination's stunning natural beauty, inviting London commuters to escape to the crystal-clear waters and pristine beaches of Turks and Caicos. Social media posts from the tourism board encourage visitors to look out for these advertisements while traveling through the tube stations.\n\nWhile the Underground advertisement serves as the most visible physical element of the campaign, Adams emphasized that it represents just one component of a comprehensive marketing strategy. "This ad based in London's tunnel is one of those initiatives," she noted, adding that the campaign includes "social media, different visual ads as well" to create maximum impact across multiple platforms.\n\nTourism officials anticipate high visibility from the campaign, citing the heavy foot traffic in London's subway system as a key factor in their marketing decision. The strategic placement aims to capture the attention of potential travelers during their daily commutes, planting the seed for future vacation planning.\n\nWhen asked about expansion plans, Adams indicated that while this would be "the only major ad of that type in London" for now, additional similar initiatives may be considered in the future as the campaign progresses. "In the future we do look to do additional ads such as that," she confirmed.\n\nThe partnership with British Airways underscores the importance of maintaining strong airlift connections between major markets and the Caribbean destination. By collaborating directly with the airline, the tourism board aims to create a seamless connection between advertisement exposure and actual booking opportunities.\n\nThe campaign, which is only a few months into its planned year-long run, reflects ongoing efforts to strengthen tourism connections between the United Kingdom and the Caribbean destination. Tourism officials will be closely monitoring the campaign's performance over the coming months, with final results expected after its completion in December.\n\n"At the end of that we'll have the results from the campaign and of course we're hoping that it will be successful," Adams concluded, expressing optimism about the initiative's potential impact on tourism numbers from the UK market.

"Each fabric choice and design is selected to ensure that no matter where you go in the world, once you have a Creatives product, you took a piece of TCI with you."\n\nRigby, who describes her brand as "self-expression," saw a gap in the local market where few businesses were highlighting Turks and Caicos culture in their designs. "I didn't just want to put anything on a piece of clothing because everybody else was just doing that," she said. "I realized that there is no one here highlighting who we are and our culture in any of those movements, and I figured I should do that."\n\nHer dedication to craftsmanship and cultural representation earned Creatives first place at last year's "Made in TCI" competition, an achievement that Rigby considers a validation of her vision and hard work.\n\nLooking to the future, Rigby has ambitious plans to take her brand to international markets, continuing to share Turks and Caicos culture with the world. However, she notes challenges in securing support from government agencies and MSME despite repeated attempts to connect with them.\n\n"I've been trying to contact the government and trying to get those in order, but no one has been reaching back to me," Rigby shared, expressing hope that increased visibility might help change this situation.\n\nAs Creatives continues to grow, Rigby remains committed to her original vision of breaking barriers and creating authentic cultural representations through fashion that locals can be proud of.\n\n"We are here in Turks and Caicos because we have a lot to be proud of," Rigby stated. "I used my way of art to showcase that."\n\nFor those interested in supporting local businesses that celebrate TCI culture, Creatives offers a chance to wear a piece of the islands' heritage with pride, wherever your travels may take you.

341	TCI Top Model 2025 Debuts Finalists At The Palms Resort	2	https://suntci.com/tci-top-model-debuts-finalists-at-the-palms-resort-p12632-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	The catwalk is calling once more with elegance, ambition, and a powerful new vision, as TCI Top Model makes its long-awaited return to the spotlight—ushering in a new generation of local talent at the much-anticipated launch event, Beauty Personalized .\n\nSet against the serene backdrop of The Spa at The Palms Resort in Grace Bay, this year's unveiling on Saturday, April 26th promises an evening of high fashion and high anticipation. But this isn't just another stylish affair— Beauty Personalized marks the official debut of the 2025 TCI Top Model contestants and the bold new direction of the franchise.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the competition opens its runway to both male and female models, reflecting a wider, more inclusive vision under the theme “En Vogue”. Ten finalists—selected from a competitive pool of 28 hopefuls—will be introduced to guests during the exclusive, resort-chic affair hosted by the ever-suave O'Brian Forbes.\n\nThe 2025 contenders who are not just about to walk a runway but to step into a legacy include:\nShakem Charles, Kavanna Hanna, Juane Familia, Mynisha Chery, MosderlinHicher, Diavion Ebanks, Ancy Dorsica, Shenylce Bello, Hubert Jr Prospere, and Niyeca Thompson.\n\nExecutive Producer and original founder Courtney Robinson is breathing fresh life into the brand after years of calls for its comeback. Following a creative hiatus and time spent in the UK, Robinson returned to the islands in 2021 and quickly recognized what had gone missing: a space for real modeling growth, professional development, and fashion-forward ambition in the TCI.\n\n“People kept reaching out for models for shoots and projects, but I couldn’t recommend anyone confidently,” Robinson explained in an earlier interview. “The ecosystem we built had vanished.”\n\nWith his long-time collaborator Michelle Swann, the idea for a comeback began to take form. What started as a spark quickly ignited into a full-on rebrand—dropping the original name TCI Top Model Contest and Fashion Extravaganza in favor of the more streamlined TCI Top Model, though fans can still expect the signature glam and high-octane flair of the past.\n\n“This is a new era,” said Robinson. “We've reimagined the show to be bigger, bolder, and more provocative. It's fashion meets theater meets transformation.”\n\nThe new season places emphasis on potential and personal growth over perfection. Open to contestants 16 and older, the show prioritizes versatility, drive, and authenticity over traditional industry molds. While certain height requirements remain (5’6”+ for women, 5’10”+ for men), the real magic lies in the willingness to learn and develop.\n\nBeyond the spotlight, the program is rooted in education. Contestants will undergo intensive training in communication, presentation, personal branding, and more—all designed to prepare them for real-world opportunities. International scouts are already keeping an eye on TCI Top Model as a serious pipeline for emerging Caribbean talent.\n\n“This is not a pageant. This is preparation for a global industry,” said Robinson. “We're building professionals.”\n\nAlumni from earlier seasons, including past winners Washanda Registry and Iberly Abreu, have already voiced their support, crediting the platform with helping launch their careers and shape their confidence. With the return of pageantry and performance gaining momentum across the islands—including the recent reboot of Miss Turks and Caicos—the timing couldn't be more perfect for TCI Top Model to make its comeback.\n\n“We're not just doing this for nostalgia,” Robinson added. “We're creating something sustainable, empowering, and uniquely ours.”\n\nOn Saturday, April 26th, 2025, at 5:00 PM, the highly anticipated Beauty Personalized event will take place at the Serene Spa at The Palms Resort in Grace Bay. Guests are encouraged to arrive at the chic resort attire for an elegant evening of fashion and flair. With tickets priced at $100 and limited seating available, early booking is recommended to secure a spot at this exclusive affair.\n\nThe grand finale will be held on Saturday, May 31, 2025, at Brayton Hall, Providenciales.

342	We Must Prepare Our Athletes Better So They Can Perform Better	2	https://suntci.com/we-must-prepare-our-athletes-better-so-they-can-perform-better-p12643-111.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	TCI did not even get one medal\n\nOur Turks and Caicos Islands team recently participated in the 52nd CARIFTA Athletics Games, which was held in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nCongratulations to all participants, especially those who improved their personal best. Unfortunately, we did not get one medal, despite having a large delegation of athletes. This situation requires immediate actions to improve our achievements.\n\nOf course, we have won medals in the past, but we really need to work on preparing our athletes better so they can achieve greater success at the CARIFTA Games and beyond.\nThis article, therefore, is by no means to attack any individual or an organization, but to provide suggestions that can be implemented. It is necessary to increase our focus on sports. Sports unite people.\n\nCARIFTA trials other than the inter-high\n\nIt is my understanding that athletes are chosen to participate in CARIFTA based on the results from the inter-high school competition which took place between March 20th to March 22nd approximately four weeks before the commencement of CARIFTA. While the inter-high school must be encouraged and continued, we should also have special CARIFTA trials early in the year to identify and choose our athletes. In this way they will have adequate time to train and prepare for CARIFTA and these same athletes should also participate in inter-high. The more practice they have, the better they will become and ultimately become victorious.\n\nHave multiple meets leading up to CARIFTA\n\nWhile training will be taking place for our athletes, we must also have multiple meets leading up to CARIFTA. In this way, it gives athletes measurable checkpoints to see how they are improving over time. It also helps athletes to manage their nerves, strategize in real time and stay mentally tough. Meets will also help to build chemistry and support among team members.\n\nRecruitment officers to scout talent\n\nFrom time to time, we have scouters coming to the TCI to recruit talent. We should do the same time internally by hiring recruitment officers and let them attend school games to observe athletes in action. There are probably a lot of athletes that have yet to be discovered but if we have recruitment officers, they can scout and identify the top talent very early even before the CARIFTA trials as proposed above.\n\nRecruitment of specialist coaches\n\nMany coaches are volunteers, and some are full-time teachers. While we appreciate the teachers serving as coaches, these teachers have a commitment to the classroom and have to focus on ensuring that they are preparing and teaching their students. So it is unfair to them to use them as coaches too, because they will not have the time and furthermore they are not getting paid for this. Recruiting specialist coaches is crucial for improving our athletes' performance. These coaches will bring a focused expertise and a results driven mindset.\n\nAthlete performance and support services needed\n\nOur athletes need support. Although a substantial number of individuals attend CARIFTA each year to show their support, this alone does not meet the needs of the participants.\nIt is essential to have a technical team responsible for verifying and securing the athletes' qualifications, health records, eligibility for CARIFTA, and travel eligibility. It has come to our attention that athletes often lack the necessary travel documents at the last minute before departure.\n\nWe also need to ensure that a nutrition program is in place for our athletes. A nutrition program is essential for athletes because their bodies have higher demands than the average person, and the right fuel can significantly impact performance, recovery, and overall health.\n\nOur athletes require performance training support because such training helps distinguish between good and elite levels. For instance, our athletes need to enhance their strength and endurance, which in turn will help our athletes to maintain high performance. A well-structured performance plan includes recovery strategies—like mobility, sleep optimization, and nutrition guidance—which help athletes recover faster and extend their careers.\n\nBelieve it or not, our athletes need psychological support. The pressure to perform, fear of failure, injuries, and public scrutiny can take a significant toll on an athlete’s mental well-being. Providing psychological support is not a luxury but a necessity for their well-being and performance.\n\nAnother major support services needed is sports medicine professionals. These professionals can develop personalized training, warm-up and recovery routines to reduce the risk of injuries.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe need to do more than talk and show up to events such as CARIFTA. If we really want to bring our people together and to provide hope for our young people, then we need to invest more in sports. I know the budget for the Sports Commission has increased significantly over the years, but we need to invest more. For example, for the last three years, we have been hearing about the provision of an Olympic-size pool, but to date, the land is not cleared yet for the construction of a pool.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands has so much potential. Quite frankly, I find it embarrassing that we have so many people attending CARIFTA and we come back with nothing. It is important to provide exposure for our athletes, but initially, we should focus on increasing their visibility domestically with the aforementioned recommendations.\n\nI challenge the Ministry of Sports, the Sports Commission and the various sports bodies to have an urgent meeting and develop a strategy so by next year, we should see significant improvement in the performance of our athletes.\n\n• Drexwell Seymour is a CPA and has an MBA in Finance.

346	Police Force Reports Surge In Gang-Related Crimes Among Young Males	2	https://suntci.com/police-force-reports-surge-in-gangrelated-crimes-among-young-males-p12630-129.htm	2025-04-28 00:00:00-04	The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force (RTCIPF) has disclosed an alarming rise in youth-involved violent crime, particularly among males aged 13 to 25.\n\nWith firearm offenses, gang violence, and aggravated robberies on the upswing, law enforcement officials and government leaders are urging immediate intervention and reform to address the growing crisis.\n\nAccording to Superintendent Grantley Williams of the RTCIPF, juvenile crime has evolved radically over the past decade. Speaking exclusively with The SUN, he shared deep concerns over the emerging patterns of criminal behaviour among the territory's youth.\n\n“The last five years have shown a shift that we can no longer ignore. What was once petty theft and vandalism is now armed robbery, firearm possession, and serious assaults,” Supt. Williams said.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, official assessments recorded 483 incidents involving juvenile suspects. Of those, 154 arrests were made, and 329 charges were laid. Burglary was the most common offense at the time, and most of the suspects were male.\n\nHowever, recent reports and operational findings from 2020 through 2024 paint a more disturbing picture. Law enforcement has observed a steady increase in violent incidents, including multiple firearm-related arrests in a single week in mid-2022.\n\n“In June 2022 alone, four young men under the age of 25 were charged with illegal firearm possession. That number should be a wake-up call for all of us,” Supt. Williams emphasized.\n\nThe superintendent noted that the current leading offenses among juveniles now include robbery with aggravation, gang-related violence, drug offenses, and wounding. The trend shows not only a rise in frequency but also in the severity of crimes.\n\n“We're not just seeing more youth arrested—we're seeing them charged with more serious offenses,” he added.\n\nDespite the rise in crime, Turks and Caicos Islands currently lack a dedicated youth correctional or rehabilitation facility. Juvenile offenders are typically held at Her Majesty's Prison in Grand Turk under special arrangements to separate them from adult inmates. However, space and resources are limited.\n\nIn some cases, particularly those involving long sentences or special care needs, young offenders are transferred to facilities in Jamaica or the United Kingdom. Supt. Williams expressed concern over this practice.\n\n“While these transfers are sometimes necessary for safety and development, they come with challenges—especially when it comes to long-term rehabilitation and reintegration,” he said.\n\nAs of early 2025, the government has initiated plans to build a juvenile rehabilitation center in Middle Caicos. The proposed facility aims to provide academic and vocational training, psychological counselling, spiritual guidance, and life skills development.\n\n“The upcoming facility is more than just a detention space—it's an opportunity for genuine reform. But until it's completed, we are working with serious gaps,” Supt. Williams acknowledged.\n\nThe government has also recognized the urgency of the issue and has begun outlining national strategies focused on youth engagement, prison reform, and the expansion of social services. Initiatives include enhanced school-based intervention programs and expanded community outreach.\n\nCourts, meanwhile, are walking a careful line between accountability and reform. While sentencing for violent offenses has become more stringent, there is a growing shift toward non-custodial sentencing and restorative justice for non-violent or first-time offenders.\n“We cannot arrest our way out of this. Prevention and rehabilitation must be just as much a part of the conversation as enforcement,” Supt. Williams stated.\n\nHe further emphasized the need for stronger institutional data to inform policy.\n“We're pushing for a national juvenile justice database to help track offenses, rehabilitation outcomes, and recidivism. Without data, we're flying blind,” he explained.\n\nAuthorities also stress the importance of early intervention, especially in schools and high-risk communities. Williams called for the integration of conflict resolution, counseling, and mentorship into the education system.\n\n“If we can reach these young men before the streets, we stand a real chance at breaking this cycle,” he said.\n\nWhile the road ahead may be complex, stakeholders across TCI's legal, social, and governmental sectors agree on one point: the current trajectory of juvenile crime must be addressed with urgency and collectively will.\n\n“The time for talk is over. This generation deserves our full commitment—not only to protect our communities but to help our youth find a better path,” Supt. Williams said.

351	STATEMENT FROM THE HONOURABLE C. WASHINGTON MISICK, PREMIER TURKS AND CAICOS GOVERNMENT	7	https://gov.tc/pressoffice/latest/statement-from-the-honourable-c-washington-misick-premier-turks-and-caicos-government	2024-05-22 00:00:00-04	As Premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands, I assure our American friends that the Turks and Caicos Islands prioritizes hospitality, cultural exchange, and mutual respect. You will find our doors open and our hearts eager to share the warmth and beauty of our homeland. We value the trust and confidence travelers from around the world place in us when they choose the Turks and Caicos Islands as their destination. Transparency and accountability are paramount in our operations, ensuring that our decisions are made lawfully and in the best interests of all residents and visitors.\n\nThe Turks & Caicos Islands welcome over one million visitors each year, more than half of whom are American.\n\nRespect for the rule of law and an independent judiciary are key tenants of our justice system, and all persons are equal in the eyes of the law. Judges are permitted to use their discretion in sentencing individuals who have been convicted of violating our Firearms law. In fact, in cases that occurred prior to the five cases that have generated media coverage, the mandatory 12-year minimum sentence has never been imposed by the Court because judges determined in each case that exceptional circumstances warranted shorter sentences.\n\nOur justice system is designed to uphold the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their place of origin, while maintaining the security and integrity of our Islands. Our judicial and law enforcement institutions are dedicated to impartiality and consistency in enforcing our laws. \n\nRecent events have underscored the importance of adhering to the principles of justice and accountability. Let me be clear: In the Turks and Caicos Islands, the law stands firm and applies to everyone equally, without exception. Our commitment to the rule of law is unwavering and remains a cornerstone of our democratic values.\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all citizens, residents and visitors.

352	FINALISATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROPOSALS	7	https://gov.tc/pressoffice/latest/finalisation-of-constitutional-reform-proposals	2024-05-21 00:00:00-04	Today Her Excellency the Governor convened a meeting with the Honourable Premier, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Attorney General, Sir Jeffrey Jowell KC and the FCDO’s Deputy Director Adam Pile to finalise the package of constitutional reform so it may be submitted to the Privy Council in July. Also in attendance was Her Excellency the Deputy Governor.\nThe bipartisan constitutional talks with the UK Government in Grand Turk (October 2023) agreed to move to a fully elected House of Assembly*, with four additional elected members replacing the members appointed by the Governor, Premier and Leader of the Opposition. In the wider package of constitutional reform, all other major issues have been agreed in further meetings and correspondence, bar the timing of a transition to a fully elected House of Assembly*.\n\nScope of work of the Electoral District Boundary Commission\n\nThe Electoral District Boundary Commission was stood up in February to review in the first instance the boundaries of the electoral districts into which the islands are divided in line with s.61 of the Constitution. The Governor, in line with the agreement of the UK Government, has asked that they then assess options for the composition of the four additional elected seats. This work will need to be put out to public consultation and submitted to the House of Assembly, after which further work will be required to implement the approved changes.\nIn order to deliver constitutional reform for the Turks and Caicos Islands this summer, the agreed package of reforms now need to be submitted to the UK Government so it may be made by His Majesty The King in the Privy Council in July.\n\nTransition to an all-elected House of Assembly*\n\n5. Given this timing, it was noted that there are two options for the transition to an all-elected House of Assembly*:\n\nA transitionary phase that provides for an all-elected House of Assembly* at the forthcoming election with four additional ‘all island’ candidates for the next term, following which the further work of the Electoral District Boundary Commission will inform the composition of the four additional seats going forward; or\nRetain the status quo of four appointed members at the forthcoming election and wait to move to an all-elected House* until the subsequent election, following the work of the Electoral District Boundary Commission which will inform the composition of the four additional seats.\n\n6. Agreement was not reached at the meeting on which option to pursue.\n\nThe Honourable Premier continues in his view that the transition to an all-elected House* should take place at the forthcoming election with the four additional elected seats contested on an ‘all island’ basis. This would be a transitionary phase, until the subsequent election where the work of the Electoral District Boundary Commission will inform what additional constituencies may be implemented.\nThe Honourable Leader of the Opposition has confirmed his view that the transition to an all-elected House of Assembly* should not take place at the forthcoming election, that the status quo should be retained with four appointed members; and the move to an all-elected House of Assembly should only take place at the subsequent election, where the work of the Electoral District Boundary Commission will inform what additional constituencies may be implemented.\n\n9. In light of the need to provide a clear position to the UK Government, a motion will be tabled for debate in the House of Assembly to allow a full debate on when a fully elected legislature should be introduced.\n\n* other than the Attorney General	Summary generation failed.	2025-04-28 20:08:29.827621-04	2025-04-28 20:08:29.827621-04	/pressoffice/images/news/cons_reform_pro.jpg	Unknown Author	\N
353	US CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION	7	https://gov.tc/pressoffice/latest/us-congressional-delegation	2024-05-20 00:00:00-04	This morning, Her Excellency the Governor Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam and the Honourable Premier Charles Washington Misick received a US Congressional delegation at the Governor's Office, Providenciales, following a request for a meeting to discuss the recent arrests of US nationals for possession of ammunition offences.\n\nThe US delegation raised five cases of US nationals currently before the courts, concern for their weil-being and clarification on the legal process.\n\nIn order to maintain the integrity of the legal process, the Governor confirmed it would not be appropriate to facilitate the delegation's request to meet with the Chief Justice.\n\nThe Governor and the Premier confirmed - as per the constitutional separation of the executive and judicial branches - they cannot intervene nor comment on ongoing legal cases before the courts. They explained that the Turks and Caicos Islands have clear laws prohibiting the possession of firearms and/or ammunition and strict penalties are in place to serve and protect all who reside and visit the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThe Hon. Attorney General confirmed possession of firearm and/or ammunition offences carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of twelve years plus a fine.\n\nWhere the court finds there are exceptional circumstances, the sentencing judge does have discretion, under the law, to impose a custodial sentence and a fine that are fair and just in the circumstances of each case rather than impose the mandatory minimum. Noting that it is for defence counsel to ensure all relevant information is put before the court.\n\nThe UK Governments Foreign Commonwealth and Development\nOffice representative who was in attendance at the meeting affirmed that the UK Government cannot comment or intervene in an ongoing legal case and that as  British Overseas Territory, the UK have full confidence in the operation of the courts of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThe Governor and Premier appreciated that the circumstances for US nationals who find themselves in this position can be difficult but were aware that US officials are providing consular support to each of the individuals. They noted that the Turks and Caicos Islands law enforcement agencies apply professional standard operating procedures for processing matters through the legal system and that they will investigate any concerns where it was felt standards were not met.\n\nThe Governor and Premier noted the prohibited items of ammunition were not identified at US departure screening; and the responsibility of travellers to ensure their baggage is free of firearms and/or ammunition prior to travel to the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThey noted that the National Security Council keeps under review the operational effectiveness of legislative provisions that underpin internal and border security. The meeting concluded with both parties recognising continued Turks and Caicos Islands -United States partnerships to tackle shared threats in the region.\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

This critical step underscores the Government's dedication to reforming and enhancing the regulatory framework for essential services including telecommunications, electricity, water, sewerage, and related services, ensuring they meet the needs and expectations of all Islanders.\n\nFollowing comprehensive studies, this approved draft policy sets the stage for a unified regulatory oversight aimed at promoting innovation, environmental sustainability, and the delivery of high-quality utility services across the TCI. The policy aims to consolidate regulatory functions under a single newly established Commission, ensuring a streamlined, efficient, and consumer-focused regulatory approach.\n\nIn the next phase of policy development, the Energy and Utilities Department, led by its commissioner, will undertake targeted stakeholder engagements. This initiative aims to involve key stakeholders such as service providers, consumer groups, and industry experts in refining the policy. Their feedback will be instrumental in ensuring the regulatory framework is both robust and reflective of the diverse interests within the utility sectors.\n\nKey Aspects of the Draft Policy:\n\nCabinet Approval: The Cabinet's endorsement of the draft policy is a testament to the Government's commitment to comprehensive utility sector regulatory reform.\n\nUnified Regulatory Body: The formation of a Regulatory Commission to oversee telecommunications, energy, water, and sewerage, optimizing regulatory processes and service standards.\n\nPrinciples and Objectives: Guided by the principles of transparency, independence, and public interest, the policy focuses on affordability, reliability, competitiveness, innovation, and environmental sustainability of utility services.\n\nEngagement with Stakeholders: Directed by the Energy and Utilities Department, this consultation period is dedicated to detailed discussions with stakeholders, ensuring a wide range of perspectives are considered in finalizing the policy.\n\nDisaster Recovery Trust Fund: An innovative approach to manage the financial impact of natural disasters on utility infrastructure and consumers, promoting rapid recovery and resilience.\n\nStakeholder Engagement Process:\n\nRecognizing the importance of inclusive policy development, the Government invites all stakeholders to actively participate in the consultation process. The Energy and Utilities Department will provide information on engagement sessions, submission guidelines, and access to the draft policy through the Government's official website and public notices.\n\nThis engagement phase is a pivotal opportunity for the TCI community to contribute to a utility regulatory framework that is aligned with our shared goals for sustainable development, technological innovation, and equitable service provision.\n\nAdditional information, when available on how to participate in the stakeholder consultations, will be posted on www.gov.tc.
