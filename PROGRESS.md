# Progress

## What Works
- The news feed now correctly loads articles sequentially without race conditions.
- The `loading` state is properly managed during all fetch operations, preventing concurrent, conflicting requests.
- The `activeContext.md` file has been created in the `memory-bank` to document the issue and its resolution for future reference.

## What's Left to Build
- The additional recommendations from the audit (XSS sanitization, accessibility improvements, performance optimizations) should be addressed in subsequent tasks.

## Current Status
- The immediate bug fix for the infinite scroll functionality is complete and implemented.

## Known Issues
- The audit identified several other areas for improvement, which are documented in the `activeContext.md` file but not yet implemented.
