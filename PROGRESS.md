# Project Progress Log - Turks and Caicos News Aggregator

This document tracks the development progress of the Turks and Caicos News Aggregator project. It complements the main `README.md` by providing a detailed log of completed tasks, current status, and planned work, organized into development phases. Avoid repeating information already present in `README.md` where possible, and instead reference it.

## Latest Update - 2025-04-20

### Current Status

The initial project structure is complete, and the backend scraping logic using the Firecrawl Node.js SDK and AI summary generation using the Groq SDK have been implemented. Date range filtering has been added to the frontend and backend. Basic styling has been applied to the filter components. The frontend build process is now successful. Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a project overview, technology stack, and structure.

### Pending Tasks Checklist

- [ ] Develop the administrative interface components (frontend) and backend routes for managing sources.
- [ ] Configure the project for deployment on your Inmotion Hosting environment.
- [ ] Add full article detail view on the frontend.
- [ ] Implement trending news logic.
- [ ] Add user authentication (if required for admin interface).

### Project Phases

The project can be organized into the following phases:

1.  **Core Data & API:** Set up the database, backend API for sources and articles, and basic frontend display. (Completed)
2.  **Scraping & AI Integration:** Implement the news scraping logic using Firecrawl and integrate the LLM for summaries. (Completed)
3.  **Frontend Enhancements:** Add filtering (date range), improve UI/UX with Tailwind/DaisyUI, and create article detail view. (Date Range Filtering, Basic Styling, and Build Process Completed, Detail View Pending)
4.  **Admin Interface:** Develop the administrative section for managing sources.
5.  **Automation & Deployment:** Implement scraping scheduling and configure the project for hosting. (Scheduling Implemented, Deployment Pending)
6.  **Advanced Features:** Implement trending news and potentially user authentication.

### Detailed Steps for Pending Tasks (Phase 3: Frontend Enhancements - Detail View)

*   **Task: Add Full Article Detail View**
    *   **Step 3.2.1:** Create a new frontend component (e.g., `ArticleDetail.tsx`) to display the full content and details of a single article.
    *   **Step 3.2.2:** Implement routing in the frontend (e.g., using `react-router-dom`) to navigate from the news feed list to the article detail view, passing the article ID as a parameter.
    *   **Step 3.2.3:** In the `ArticleDetail.tsx` component, fetch the specific article data from the backend API using the article ID from the route parameters (`GET /api/articles/:id`).
    *   **Step 3.2.4:** Render the full article title, source, date, summary, and raw content in the `ArticleDetail.tsx` component.
    *   **Step 3.2.5:** Update the `NewsFeed.tsx` component to include links (e.g., using React Router's `Link` component) on each article title or card that navigate to the corresponding article detail view.

### Documentation Guidelines

*   **Cross-referencing:** Use links (`[Link Text](./path/to/file)`) to refer to other documentation files (e.g., linking to `README.md` for project overview).
*   **Avoid Repetition:** Do not duplicate detailed information across multiple documentation files. Each file should serve a specific purpose (e.g., `README.md` for overview, `PROGRESS.md` for development log, `db/schema.sql` for schema details).
*   **Complementary Information:** Ensure documentation files complement each other, providing different levels of detail or focusing on specific aspects of the project.
