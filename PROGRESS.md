# Project Progress

## June 19, 2025

- **Task:** Analyze and fix the infinite scroll functionality on the main newsfeed page.
- **Investigation:**
    - Analyzed `frontend/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx` and confirmed the infinite scroll logic was correctly implemented.
    - Tested the backend API at `https://mango-news.onrender.com/api/articles` and verified that it supports pagination correctly.
    - Examined `frontend/src/components/IndexPage.tsx` to check the props being passed to `NewsFeed`.
- **Issue Identified:** The `useEffect` hook in `NewsFeed.tsx` that fetches articles had `searchTerm` in its dependency array. This caused issues with fetching subsequent pages when scrolling due to the debounced search term.
- **Resolution:** Removed `searchTerm` from the dependency array of the main fetch `useEffect` in `frontend/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx`.
- **Status:** The infinite scroll functionality is now fixed and working as expected.
