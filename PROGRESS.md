# Project Progress

## UI/Styling Improvements (2025-04-22)

- Defined a modern aesthetic color palette in `frontend/src/app/globals.css` using CSS variables for light and dark modes.
- Configured custom typography in `frontend/tailwind.config.js` using Geist fonts and a responsive text scale.
- Applied initial styling and responsiveness to the main page layout (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`), including the header and filter section.
- Styled the `TopicFilter.tsx` component with the new color palette and typography.
- Styled the `DateRangeFilter.tsx` component with the new color palette, typography, and improved button responsiveness.
- Styled the `NewsFeed.tsx` component, applying the new aesthetic to article cards and content, including hover effects.
- Ensured the necessary dependencies (`tailwindcss-animate` and `uploadthing`) are installed in the frontend project.
- Initialized shadcn/ui in the frontend project.
- Added shadcn/ui `button`, `dropdown-menu`, `checkbox`, `label`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, and `switch` components.
- Installed `next-themes` for theme management.
- Implemented a `ThemeProvider` component to wrap the root layout.
- Created and added a `ThemeSwitcher` component to the navbar in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` using shadcn/ui components and `next-themes`.
- Moved the navbar and ThemeSwitcher component to `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to make it persistent across all pages.
- Refactored the Admin Dashboard page (`frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button, Checkbox, Label).
- Refactored the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button, Checkbox, Label, Input, Textarea, Card).
- Styled the Article Detail page (`frontend/src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button).
- Improved visibility of the URL link in the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) by changing its text color to primary.
- Adjusted the modal overlay styling in the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to use a semi-transparent black background (`bg-black/50`) and ensured the modal content uses theme-appropriate background and text colors.
- Changed checkbox fields to toggle switches (`Switch` component) on the Admin Dashboard and Source Management pages based on user feedback.
- Consolidated all specified navigation elements (Home, Admin, Manage Sources links) into the persistent navbar to ensure consistent navigation.
- Incorporated design ideas from provided code snippet into the Home page (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`), including adding a search bar and category tabs.
- Updated `NewsFeed.tsx` to accept `searchTerm` and `activeCategory` props and filter articles client-side.
- Implemented the Source Discovery Feature on the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`), including displaying discovered sources with an option to add them. **Updated the frontend logic to attempt to connect to a backend endpoint for discovery, but full functionality depends on backend implementation.**
- Created and added a Comprehensive Footer component to the root layout.
- Enhanced NewsFeed card display to include images, topics, and source type indicators.
- Improved Loading and Empty States styling in `NewsFeed.tsx`.
- Updated the Footer component to fetch news sources dynamically from the backend API instead of using hardcoded data based on user feedback.

- Updated the Footer component to fetch news sources dynamically from the backend API instead of using hardcoded data based on user feedback.
- Added a `scraping_method` field to the `sources` table in the database schema (`db/schema.sql`) to allow selecting different scraping methods per source.
- Updated the backend API endpoints (`backend/src/index.js`) to handle the new `scraping_method` field for fetching, adding, and updating sources.
- Updated the frontend Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to include a dropdown for selecting the scraping method when adding or editing a source.
- Created a new backend file (`backend/src/opensourceScraper.js`) to house the open-source scraping logic using Puppeteer. (Note: Basic implementation for demonstration, requires further development for robust discovery and scraping).
- Modified the main scraper logic (`backend/src/scraper.js`) to select the appropriate scraping method (Firecrawl or open-source) based on the source's configuration.
- Added a basic endpoint for source discovery using the open-source scraper to the backend (`backend/src/index.js`).

**Next Steps:**

- Conduct thorough testing of the open-source scraping method with diverse news sources.
- Address any remaining issues or edge cases identified during testing.
- Finalize documentation for the scraping methods and UI guidelines.
- Perform a final review and cleanup of the codebase.
- Implement further accessibility enhancements.
- Refine responsive design for specific components as needed.
- Add documentation for the new UI/Styling guidelines and scraping methods in the `/docs` folder.
- Suggest a git commit and push to mark the completion of this milestone.
