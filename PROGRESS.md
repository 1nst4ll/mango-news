## UI/Styling Improvements (2025-04-21)

- Defined a modern aesthetic color palette in `frontend/src/app/globals.css` using CSS variables for light and dark modes.
- Configured custom typography in `frontend/tailwind.config.js` using Geist fonts and a responsive text scale.
- Applied initial styling and responsiveness to the main page layout (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`), including the header and filter section.
- Styled the `TopicFilter.tsx` component with the new color palette and typography.
- Styled the `DateRangeFilter.tsx` component with the new color palette, typography, and improved button responsiveness.
- Styled the `NewsFeed.tsx` component, applying the new aesthetic to article cards and content, including hover effects.
- Ensured the necessary dependencies (`tailwindcss-animate` and `uploadthing`) are installed in the frontend project.
- Initialized shadcn/ui in the frontend project.
- Added shadcn/ui `button`, `dropdown-menu`, `checkbox`, `label`, `input`, `textarea`, and `card` components.
- Installed `next-themes` for theme management.
- Implemented a `ThemeProvider` component to wrap the root layout.
- Created and added a `ThemeSwitcher` component to the navbar in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` using shadcn/ui components and `next-themes`.
- Moved the navbar and ThemeSwitcher component to `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to make it persistent across all pages.
- Refactored the Admin Dashboard page (`frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button, Checkbox, Label).
- Refactored the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button, Checkbox, Label, Input, Textarea, Card).
- Styled the Article Detail page (`frontend/src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button).
- **Improved visibility of the URL link in the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) by changing its text color to primary.**

**Next Steps:**

- Implement further accessibility enhancements.
- Refine responsive design for specific components as needed.
- Add documentation for the new UI/Styling guidelines in the `/docs` folder.
