# Project Progress

## Documentation Update (Phase 2 - In Progress)

- Updated `README.md` to reflect the current project status, technology stack, project structure, implemented functionality, setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and documentation guidelines.
- Reviewing and updating other documentation files (`docs/README.md`, `docs/admin-ui.md`, `docs/backend-setup.md`, `docs/css-selectors.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, `docs/frontend-ui.md`, `docs/scraping-methods.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`) to ensure consistency and accuracy with the updated `README.md` and the current project state.

## Documentation Audit and Update (Completed on 2025-05-01)

- Styled the `DateRangeFilter.tsx` component with the new color palette, typography, and improved button responsiveness.
- Styled the `NewsFeed.tsx` component, applying the new aesthetic to article cards and content, including hover effects.

- Added shadcn/ui `button`, `dropdown-menu`, `checkbox`, `label`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, and `switch` components.
- Installed `next-themes` for theme management.
- Implemented a `ThemeProvider` component to wrap the root layout.
- Created and added a `ThemeSwitcher` component to the navbar in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` using shadcn/ui components and `next-themes`.
- Moved the navbar and ThemeSwitcher component to `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to make it persistent across all pages.
- Added display for database statistics (total articles, total sources) on the Admin Dashboard page (`frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) using shadcn/ui `Card` components. **Note: Requires backend endpoint implementation to fetch actual statistics.**
- Audited and updated the styling of the Admin Dashboard page (`frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to use shadcn/ui `Card` components for the main content and status messages.
- Audited and updated the styling of the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to use the shadcn/ui `Select` component for the scraping method dropdown in the Add/Edit Source modal, further aligning with shadcn/ui elements.
- Refactored the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to match app styling, including applying the new color palette, typography, and integrating shadcn/ui components (Button, Checkbox, Label, Input, Textarea, Card).

- Improved visibility of the source URL link on the Article Detail page (`frontend/src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx`) by changing its text color to primary.
- Improved visibility of the URL link in the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) by changing its text color to primary.
- Adjusted the modal overlay styling in the Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to use a semi-transparent black background (`bg-black/50`) and ensured the modal content uses theme-appropriate background and text colors.
- Changed checkbox fields to toggle switches (`Switch` component) on the Admin Dashboard and Source Management pages based on user feedback.

- Updated the frontend Source Management page (`frontend/src/app/admin/sources/page.tsx`) to include a dropdown for selecting the scraping method when adding or editing a source.
- Created a new backend file (`backend/src/opensourceScraper.js`) to house the open-source scraping logic using Puppeteer. (Note: Basic implementation for demonstration, requires further development for robust discovery and scraping).
- Modified the main scraper logic (`backend/src/scraper.js`) to select the appropriate scraping method (Firecrawl or open-source) based on the source's configuration.
- Added a basic endpoint for source discovery using the open-source scraper to the backend (`backend/src/index.js`).
- Implemented PostgreSQL database persistence for sources in the backend (`backend/src/index.js`), replacing the in-memory data store.
- Updated backend API endpoints (`/api/sources`, `/api/sources/:id`) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- Installed the `pg` package in the backend.
- Added toggles/buttons to the Admin Dashboard (`frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to trigger the full scraper run (`/api/scrape/run`) and purge articles (`/api/articles/purge`).

- Updated `README.md` and `docs/scraping-methods.md` to document the AI image generation feature.

## Next Steps: Astro Frontend Migration

- Refine the Tailwind CSS styling across all pages and components for a polished look and feel, ensuring consistency with the defined aesthetic.
- Implement TanStack Query for data fetching in the Astro frontend, replacing the current `fetch` and `useState`/`useEffect` logic in the React islands.
- Conduct thorough testing of the new Astro frontend to ensure all features are working correctly.
- Update remaining documentation files (if any) to reflect the completed migration.
- Perform a final review and cleanup of the Astro codebase.
- Remove the old `frontend` directory once the Astro migration is complete and verified.
- Suggest a git commit and push to mark the completion of the frontend migration milestone.
