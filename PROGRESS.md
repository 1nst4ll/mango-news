# Project Progress Log - Turks and Caicos News Aggregator

This document tracks the development progress of the Turks and Caicos News Aggregator project. It complements the main `README.md` by providing a detailed log of completed tasks, current status, and planned work, organized into development phases. Avoid repeating information already present in `README.md` where possible, and instead reference it.

## Latest Update - 2025-04-21

### Current Status

Audited the existing scraping process and reevaluated the strategy using the Firecrawl tool. Updated the scraper logic to improve content extraction by removing specific HTML tag filtering and adding post-processing to clean the scraped markdown content.

### Completed Tasks Checklist

- [x] Audited scraping process and refined strategy based on Firecrawl tool testing.
- [x] Applied DaisyUI styling to frontend components (`App.tsx`, `NewsFeed.tsx`, `TopicFilter.tsx`, `DateRangeFilter.tsx`, `ArticleDetail.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `SourceManagement.tsx`).

## Latest Update - 2025-04-21

### Current Status

Significant progress has been made on the scraping and administrative features. The scraper logic has been refactored to extract individual articles from source pages and save them to the database. Backend endpoints and frontend buttons have been added to trigger full scrapes, scrape individual sources, and purge all articles. Several issues related to database permissions, Firecrawl SDK usage, and Groq API calls have been diagnosed and addressed. Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a project overview, technology stack, and structure.

### Pending Tasks Checklist

- [ ] Configure the project for deployment on your Inmotion Hosting environment.
- [ ] Implement trending news logic.
- [ ] Add user authentication (if required for admin interface).

### Project Phases

The project can be organized into the following phases:

1.  **Core Data & API:** Set up the database, backend API for sources and articles, and basic frontend display. (Completed)
2.  **Scraping & AI Integration:** Implement the news scraping logic using Firecrawl and integrate the LLM for summaries. (Completed)
3.  **Frontend Enhancements:** Add filtering (date range), improve UI/UX with Tailwind/DaisyUI, and create article detail view. (Completed)
4.  **Admin Interface:** Develop the administrative section for managing sources. (Completed)
5.  **Automation & Deployment:** Implement scraping scheduling and configure the project for hosting. (Scheduling Implemented, Deployment Pending)
6.  **Advanced Features:** Implement trending news and potentially user authentication.

### Detailed Steps for Pending Tasks (Phase 5: Automation & Deployment)

*   **Task: Configure Project for Deployment**
    *   **Step 5.1.1:** Review Inmotion Hosting environment details and requirements (e.g., Node.js version, PostgreSQL access, Nginx configuration).
    *   **Step 5.1.2:** Update backend configuration (e.g., database connection string) to use environment variables suitable for the hosting environment.
    *   **Step 5.1.3:** Configure Nginx on the hosting server to serve the frontend static files and proxy API requests to the backend Node.js application.
    *   **Step 5.1.4:** Ensure the `node-cron` scheduler in `backend/src/scraper.js` is configured to run persistently on the server.
    *   **Step 5.1.5:** Deploy the backend and frontend code to the hosting environment.
    *   **Step 5.1.6:** Test the deployed application to ensure both frontend and backend are functioning correctly and can connect to the database.

### Documentation Guidelines

*   **Cross-referencing:** Use links (`[Link Text](./path/to/file)`) to refer to other documentation files (e.g., linking to `README.md` for project overview).
*   **Avoid Repetition:** Do not duplicate detailed information across multiple documentation files. Each file should serve a specific purpose (e.g., `README.md` for overview, `PROGRESS.md` for development log, `db/schema.sql` for schema details).
*   **Complementary Information:** Ensure documentation files complement each other, providing different levels of detail or focusing on specific aspects of the project.

**Recent Work:** Implemented content filtering in the backend scraper (`backend/src/scraper.js`) to include only the main article content and exclude social sharing sections, iframes, and images within links. Updated the frontend `ArticleDetail.tsx` component to use `react-markdown` to render the scraped content. Refined the scraping strategy by removing specific HTML tag filtering and adding post-processing logic to clean unwanted header/footer text and related article links from the scraped markdown.

**Unresolved Issues:** Currently experiencing a persistent file corruption issue with `backend/src/scraper.js` that prevents reliable saving of changes. Also encountering Groq API rate limits during scraping.
