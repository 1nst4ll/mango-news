# Progress

## What Works
- The news feed's infinite scroll functionality is now fully repaired and robust.
- All identified race conditions and runaway fetching bugs have been resolved by implementing the correct `useCallback` ref pattern for the `IntersectionObserver`.
- The component's state management is now stable and predictable.
- The `activeContext.md` file is fully updated with the final, correct solution.

## What's Left to Build
- The additional recommendations from the initial audit (XSS sanitization, accessibility improvements, performance optimizations for the backend) should be addressed in subsequent tasks.

## Current Status
- The infinite scroll functionality is complete and production-ready.

## Known Issues
- The non-critical issues identified in the initial audit still exist and are documented in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
