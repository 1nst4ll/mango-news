# Turks and Caicos News Aggregator

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a centralized platform for accessing local news from the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). It achieves this by automatically scraping news articles from various local TCI news websites and consolidating them into a single, organized news feed. The platform provides users with tools to filter and explore the news, while providing administrators with backend control over the data sources.

## Key Features

*   **Automated News Scraping:** Regularly scrape articles from a curated list of local TCI news websites using the Firecrawl MCP Server.
*   **Consolidated News Feed:** Present all scraped articles in a single, unified feed.
*   **Article Details:** Display essential information for each article, including:
    *   Title
    *   Source
    *   Timestamp (Publication Date)
    *   Relevant Topics/Tags
    *   AI-generated summary
*   **Backend Source Management:** An administrative interface to manage news sources.
*   **Frontend Filtering:** User interface allowing users to filter the news feed by Topics/Tags and Date Range.
*   **Trending News:** A section highlighting currently trending or popular news articles.
